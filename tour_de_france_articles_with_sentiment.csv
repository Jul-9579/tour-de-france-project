"'3-2-1, C’est Partiiieeee' - Remco Evenepoel begins Tour de France preparation",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/3-2-1-cest-partiiieeee-remco-evenepoel-begins-tour-de-france-preparation/,0.916,"Remco Evenepoelhas kicked off his preparation for the 2025Tour de France, with a first ride on home roads.
Between now and Saturday July 5, when the Tour begins in Lille, in northern France, Evenepoel will gradually increase his training load, attend a three-week altitude train camp and race theCriterium du Dauphine(June 8-15) and the Belgian national championships on June 27 and 29.
Evenepoel signalled the start of his Tour de France training on Strava, naming a 70km near his home south of Brussels as ""3-2-1, C’est Partiiieeee' with an emoticon of a French flag and a baguette.
Evenepoel finished third overall behind Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard as he made his Tour de France debut last summer. He won the time trial stage and the best young rider's white jersey.
Evenepoel took a week of racing and structured training after riding the recent Tour de Romandie. He won the final time trial around Geneva and finished fifth overall in the Swiss stage race.
The Soudal-QuickStep team leader was forced to take six weeks off the bike to recover after beingdoored by a driver in training on December 3.
He fractured his rib, hand and shoulder blade, and dislocated his collarbone, which has causednerve damage in his shoulderand further slowed his return to training. He made his 2025 debut at the De Brabantse Pijl and won the one-day race before finishing third at Amstel Gold Race and ninth at Flèche Wallonne.

“I can look back on these last couple of weeks with satisfaction. I took two wins since returning to competition and found the rhythm again,"" Evenepoel said after his block of racing.
""Not everything went as I had wanted and hoped in some of the races, but it’s only normal after so much time off the bike. I will now recover a bit and then continue my preparations for the summer."""
"'It is not a game, it is a fight' – Lotto CEO gives insight into sponsorship struggle after finding temporary Tour de France solution",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/it-is-not-a-game-it-is-a-fight-lotto-ceo-gives-insight-into-sponsorship-struggle-after-finding-temporary-tour-de-france-solution/,0.9967,"Amid the struggle for sponsorship among lower-budget teams in cycling, one team boss has said the situation ""is not a game, it is a fight,"" with the clock ticking on finding more funding for 2026 and beyond.
Arkéa-B&B Hotels confirmed on Wednesday that their two title sponsors would not be renewingfor next season, putting them in the most dire position, but the likes of Alpecin-Deceuninck and Belgian teamLottoare also in the hunt for a new title sponsor.
Whileset to be promoted back into the WorldTourthanks to their success throughout the three-year cycle, Lotto have struggled throughout 2025. Not only has headline riderArnaud De Lie faced several setbacks, but they also still have a co-title sponsor funding black hole to replace.
CEO Stéphane Heulot gave detailed insight into their sponsorship woes, speaking toWielerFlits, after Lotto unveiled a new jersey for the Tour de France, with longstanding sponsor CAPS temporarily filling the second title spot. While not permanent, the fuel and charging card company making an ""extra effort"" has been a win-win situation for Lotto's Tour.
""There are a number of very nice names on the table, but nothing has been finalized at the moment. I am very busy with sponsors, but it is clear that there are increasing costs in the peloton because of inflation,"" Heulot toldWielerFlits.
""You also see what's going on in the world right now, right? A lot of companies are affected by that. Sports sponsorship is therefore not the top priority for many of those companies.""
""It is very difficult to fight with the biggest teams, but even with the budget that we have or are aiming for, we can still do nice things. Ideally, we want to end up with the average budget of a WorldTeam, but that is not easy. Today we are not even halfway there.

""I am optimistic. Ultimately, the most important thing at the moment is that we continue to do well in the WorldTour ranking. We will almost certainly be promoted to the WorldTour and as far as the sponsor is concerned, I remain positive.""
Despite Lotto's commitment to finding Belgian support, the struggle is forcing them to ""look everywhere"", especially with the competition among Belgian WorldTour and ProSeries teams to secure new sponsors.
""Those teams are all in the same situation. Alpecin-Deceuninck, Soudal Quick-Step and Intermarché-Wanty are also looking for partners,"" said Lotto's CEO.
""There are also examples of situations in which we are talking to a sponsor, but suddenly other teams appear and steal the sponsor if we let the talks drag on for too long. It is not a game, it is a fight.""
While the sponsorship picture may be experiencing a race to the bottom, Heulot's undying positivity around his own team's future extended to the wider picture in cycling, confident that things will get better.
""I can hardly imagine that it will get worse. To have a good sport, it is important that there is sufficient equity. That gives teams power,"" he told the Dutch publication.
""For example, we see a team like UAE Team Emirates-XRG, who have five riders in their selection for the grand tours who can win. I don't think that such a situation is interesting for the spectators to see. Then there is no battle.
""But when I look at our own team, it's important to stay true to our values ​​and our DNA. And that's clearly our focus on young riders. We don't aim to buy a rider who is in the top five in the world, but we can develop a future top five rider.""This year was not a good example, but in 2023 and 2024 we have proven that with that strategy we can be amongst the top 10 teams in the world.""
Lotto should survive well into the next WorldTour cycle and beyond, but they will want to entice a new title sponsor sooner rather than later, to replace the void left in their budget by the departure of Dstny. A strong performance at the Tour de France from De Lie and Lennert Van Eetvelt could well be the key to their long-term survival.

"'Compared to last year, we have taken another big step' – Visma management rate Jonas Vingegaard as favourite for Tour de France",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/compared-to-last-year-we-have-taken-another-big-step-visma-management-rate-jonas-vingegaard-as-favourite-for-tour-de-france/,0.9828,"Visma-Lease A Bike manager Richard Plugge has said thatJonas Vingegaardwill be the strongest rider over the course of three weeks at the Tour de France, proclaiming that the Dane should be the favourite ahead ofTadej Pogačar.
The Danish star will be taking aim at his third career Tour de France title this July, with the pair having shared the previous five Tour wins among themselves.
Pogačar, who won the race in 2020, 2021 and 2024, is rated as the top favourite, by a narrow margin, for victory again this season. He has proven near unbeatable since the start of 2024, racking up 32 victories including the Tour, the Giro d'Italia, the World Championships, and four Monuments.
Last year'sTour de Francevictory, with a 6:17 margin over Vingegaard, came after the Dane saw his preparation badly disrupted by a career-threatening crash at Itzulia Basque Country.
This time around, there'll be no such caveat, and Plugge rates Vingegaard as the better rider over the course of a Grand Tour.
""You could perhaps say that Pogačar is better on Tour of Flanders-like courses, but this is about a three-week race. And in our view, Jonas is better at that, to be able to handle that accumulation of fatigue, etc,"" Plugge toldWielerFlitson Wednesday.
Both Vingegaard and Pogačar have been ramping up their preparations for July recently, having headed to high altitude in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in Spain for separate team training camps. The duo will return to racing in June for their final Tour de France preparation race, theCritérium du Dauphiné, next month.

So far in 2025, Pogačar has dominated the season with seven wins in 14 race days – including the UAE Tour, Strade Bianche,Tour of Flanders, La Flèche Wallonne, and Liège-Bastogne-Liège.
Vingegaard has raced a more limited schedule, winning the Volta ao Algarve before racing Paris-Nice, which he was forced to abandon after a crash andresulting concussion.
Plugge acknowledged that Pogačar and his UAE Team Emirates-XRG squad had made improvements since losing the 2023 Tour but said that Vingegaard and Visma-Lease A Bike have done the same since last summer.
""Due to circumstances, Jonas was simply less in the final week last year,"" he said. ""I do think that UAE Team Emirates-XRG has made progress after the time trial to Combloux"" - won by Vingegaard and effectively sealing his overall victory that year -  ""in the 2023 Tour.""
""But so have we. And we are mainly looking at ourselves and how we can improve our performance. Compared to last year, we have taken another big step in that regard.
""Jonas has gained minutes on Pogačar for two years in a row. Last year, after a very flawed start and a pretty bad finish, physically, Jonas was also a big competitor towards the end.
""Jonas has also made progress again. I have no reason not to believe that we can go for yellow again."""
"'Tough, irregular, very long' – Remco Evenepoel prepares for Tour de France with Col de la Loze recon",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/tough-irregular-very-long-remco-evenepoel-prepares-for-tour-de-france-with-col-de-la-loze-recon/,0.9133,"The topTour de Francecontenders are currently putting their finishing touches on their preparation for next month's race,spending time at altitudeand riding recons of the key Alpine climbs.
Reigning championTadej Pogačaris taking part in one final training camp with UAE Team Emirates-XRG at Isola 2000, while his main rivals Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike),Remco Evenepoel(Soudal-QuickStep) and Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) are based further north in the Alps in Tignes.
Evenepoel, who has ground to make up on Pogačar and Vingegaard after finishing fourth at the Critérium du Dauphiné, ventured out to recon the longest climb of the2025 Tour de France routeearlier this week, the vital ascent of the Col de la Loze.
The climb has been tackled twice before on the Tour, once on stage 17 in 2020 when Miguel Angel López soloed to victory ahead of the Roglič-Pogačar GC battle, and again on stage 17 in 2023 when Pogačar famously cracked on the road to Courchevel, losing the Tour to Vingegaard.
The 26.2km ascent, which averages 6.5%, concludes arguably the queen stage of the 2025 Tour, a 171km stage featuring 5,800 metres of climbing including the Col du Glandon (21.7km at 5.2%) and the Col de la Madeleine (19.1km at 7.9%).
Evenepoel climbed to the top of the Loze, 2,304 metres above sea level, on Sunday alongside Soudal-QuickStep teammates Max Schachmann and Valentin Paret-Peintre before giving his thoughts to local sports clubCourchevel Sports Outdoor.
""It's tough, eh? It's very irregular. The climb is very, very long. It's the longest climb of the Tour de France this year,"" Evenepoel said in a short interview posted to Instagram by Courchevel Sports Outdoor.

""Arriving here is never easy, and it's the first time we'll be climbing from Courchevel. I think it will be a pretty tough stage with the Glandon and the Madeleine. It won't be easy, but it will be a great stage.""
Evenepoel wasn't the only Tour de France contender to tackle the Col de la Loze on Sunday.
Courchevel Sports Outdoor also spotted Visma-Lease A Bike riding up the climb, withJonas Vingegaardjoined by Wout van Aert, Matteo Jorgenson, Victor Campenaerts and several other Visma teammates for the ascent.

"'No bad feeling' towards Uno-X after Tour de France non-selection, says Alexander Kristoff",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/no-bad-feeling-towards-uno-x-after-tour-de-france-non-selection-says-alexander-kristoff/,0.9606,"Alexander Kristoffhas said that ""there's no bad feeling"" from him towards his Uno-X Mobility team after he was passed over for selection for what would have been his finalTour de Francethis summer.
The 37-year-old is a veteran of 11 Tours de France, having picked up four stage wins at the race during his career. Kristoff announced earlier this season that 2025 will be his final road racing campaign, and he had hoped to ride the Tour one last time before retirement.
However,Uno-X Mobilityhave decided to leave him off theireight-man rosterfor this year's race, instead selecting Søren Wærenskjold and Stian Fredheim as their go-to fast men.
Speaking toTV2.noon Monday, Kristoff said he was ""a little disappointed"" about the decision but bore no ill will towards team management.
""There's no denying that I'm a little disappointed. At the same time, Stian Fredheim has performed well this year and made progress, so it's probably also a decision for the future,"" Kristoff said.
""We had a good chat. There's no bad feeling between us. I understand how they think, and Tobias Halland Johannessen is in great shape and needs some support... But it's disappointing not to get my last Tour.""
Uno-X Mobility manager Thor Hushovd said that the decision came at the end of a ""difficult process"", with the final selection made on Saturday evening.

""I think it's difficult with Alexander Kristoff, with everything he's done for many, many years. But now we're looking to the future, and there are many young people coming up. So that's how it turned out this year,"" Hushovd explained.
Kristoff has picked up one win so far in 2025, at the Vuelta a Andalucía, as well as several podium spots across the Tour of Turkey and Tour of Norway.
In his place, the team has gone with Omloop Het Nieuwsblad champion Wærenskjold and Fredheim, who won La Route Adélie de Vitré in April and placed fourth on a stage of the Critérium du Dauphiné last week.
""We believe that Wærenskjold has a higher top speed, and we think that Fredheim is a bit more consistent on the slopes,"" Hushovd said.
""So, if Søren were to fall off on the semi-hard sprint stages, we believe that Fredheim has a slightly better chance of being included. He's proved that in the Dauphiné. He has a good finish, and Wærenskjold trusts him 100%.
""[Kristoff] was disappointed, but he realised it. He took it like a man. He understood the reasons.""
Elsewhere in the team,Frederik Dversneswas disappointed to miss the selection, too. The 28-year-old, who won a breakaway stage at Tirreno-Adriatico this season, toldTV2.nothat he believed his upcoming wedding had some influence on his non-selection.
Dversnes is set to get married this Friday and said, ""I feel that there have been an incredible number of hints that I'm getting married. I don't think everyone in management was equally happy about it.""
The Norwegian said he won't let the feelings of disappointment ""overshadow a day he's really looking forward to"", while Hushovd denied that Dversnes' upcoming wedding had anything to do with the team's decision.
""It hasn't been mentioned anywhere. It's nice that he's getting married! But I would never have got married that weekend, I have to say,"" Hushovd said.
""It may well be that he's had a few nudges from the sports directors, but I didn't know until you said it now that he was getting married this weekend. It hasn't in any way, shape or form contributed to the decision. This is an overall assessment.""

'It's all out of respect' – Visma-Lease a Bike and UAE Team Emirates-XRG excited to reignite Grand Tour rivalry at Tour de France,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/its-all-out-of-respect-visma-lease-a-bike-and-uae-team-emirates-xrg-excited-to-reignite-grand-tour-rivalry-at-tour-de-france/,0.9996,"The Grand Tour rivalry betweenVisma-Lease a BikeandUAE Team Emirates-XRGis set to enter its second round in 2025 at next month'sTour de Franceafter 11 of the last 15 Grand Tours in men's cycling have been claimed by the two super teams.
Their rivalry isn't bitter, however, but one that comes with respect and forces cycling's top two teams to get better, according to the former's Managing Director, Richard Plugge.
""Mauro Gianetti and I just spoke, and we have a lot of respect for each other,"" Plugge toldCyclingnews, after Simon Yates snatched a the Giro d'Italia title from the Emirati squad's hands on the penultimate day.
""They push us to become better, and I think, I hope, we do it with his team and him, and that's what makes sports really beautiful.
""You win something, then you lose something, and you think next time, 'I have to beat him', but it's all out of respect, and that's what makes this sport, and every sport, incredibly nice.""
During last week'sGiro d'Italiafinale, it was Visma'sSimon Yatesand UAE's Isaac del Toro who finished in the top two positions, with theBrit coming out on top in dramatic fashion. In July, it will be their top superstars – Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogačar – who duke it out for the maillot jaune.
Having not seen Vingegaard race since heleft Paris-Nice with a concussionin March, his only appearance before the Tour's Grand Départ on July 5 will come at next week'sCritérium du Dauphiné.

Pogačar will also be racing the key eight-stage form-marking race, but with the Tour not far away, Plugge is only excited at the prospect of his star Dane coming face to face with cycling's top rider at the biggest race on the calendar.
""We did not raise the bar [for July by winning the Giro], we know Jonas made a step this year in the wintertime,"" said Plugge.
""We have a very strong opponent, but I think in a three-week race, they are getting closer to each other than in the one-day races, because Pogačar is phenomenal in these. In a three-week race, it will be very exciting to see how far we get.""
Yates took the latest of Visma-Lease a Bike's Grand Tour wins at the Giro, winning with a stunning attack on the Colle delle Finestre, and a strong assist from Wout van Aert on stage 20. He will be at the Tour, too, but as Vingegaard's super climbing domestique.
The Brit's overall win brought the Dutch team's Grand Tour title tally up to eight since Plugge took over and transformed the then Rabobank squad into Visma as we know it today, with the culture and idea of winning together being crucial to their rapid rise.
Yates is also their fourth rider from the team to win one of cycling's prestigious three-week races, while UAE have only been able to triumph through Pogačar, with the likes of Del Toro, João Almeida and another super prospect, Juan Ayuso, falling short in the past three seasons.
Plugge didn't have an exact answer for his rival, but credited much of Visma's continued success, even after the departure of Grand Tour mastermind Merijn Zeeman last summer, down to the team's culture of togetherness.
""We now have four winners, Sepp [Kuss], Jonas [Vingegaard], Primož [Roglič] and Simon [Yates],"" said Plugge.
""I think what we try to do is have a really good programme, a really good team. Our team culture, which Wout van Aert is a personification of, is that we put in 100% for everyone, and we help everyone to win.""
Yates, after 11 years at GreenEdge Cycling, bought into this, and it enabled him tofind a possible unseen previous top level, and allowed him to complete the ultimate redemption victory story on the climb, which infamously saw him lose the Giro back in 2018.
""Simon is very good indeed, maybe better than he ever was before, but he also has a team now that works for him, sacrifices for him, puts him in positions in front of the race,"" said the Visma team boss.
""For example, when crashes happened, we were in the right spot there. Of course, it's a bit of luck on one hand, but on the other, it's where you need to be at that time, and that's where the team helps a lot.
""That's how we do it: working together, winning together, and losing together."""
Tour de France sprinters prepare for opening day yellow jersey battle with showdown at Baloise Belgium Tour,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/tour-de-france-sprinters-prepare-for-opening-day-yellow-jersey-battle-with-showdown-at-baloise-belgium-tour/,0.9983,"With the Critérium du Dauphiné in the books and the Tour de Suisse underway, anotherTour de Francepreparation race kicks off on Wednesday as several top sprinters take on theBaloise Belgium Tour.
Nine-time Tour stage winnerJasper Philipsen(Alpecin-Deceuninck) and fellow Belgian sprinting starTim Merlier(Soudal-QuickStep) headline the sprinting lineup at the five-day race as they look to put the finishing touches on their preparation for the biggest race of the year in July.
The pair will both be eyeing the opening day of the Tour, a flat 185km stage in Lille, as a chance to grab the first victory of the race and with it a rare shot at a yellow jersey for a sprinter.
Before that, they'll face off against the likes of Casper Van Uden (Picnic-PostNL), Juan Sebastián Molano (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Fernando Gaviria (Movistar), and Alberto Dainese (Tudor) in Belgium.
Speaking toWielerFlitsahead of Wednesday's opening stage, 2023 Tour green jersey winner Philipsen said he'll be aiming for the maillot jaune in Lille.
""It is, of course, a great opportunity for the first yellow jersey. That is what we are going for, but the Tour lasts three weeks and I hope to be there from start to finish,"" Philipsen said.
He'll once again be able to rely on teammateMathieu van der Poelin the Alpecin-Deceuninck lead-out train this July and said that the Dutchman looks to be in flying form following his impressive showing at the Critérium du Dauphiné.

""What he showed in the Critérium du Dauphiné is promising,"" he said. ""His condition looks very good. I have not often seen him in such a condition for the Tour.""
Merlier, meanwhile, will return to the Tour for the first time since 2021, when he won stage 3. Back then, he raced alongside Philipsen on the same team but was forced to abandon on stage 9 after dropping from the gruppetto in the Alps.
This year, he'll form part ofRemco Evenepoel's team as the Belgian seeks to battle for the yellow jersey, meaning he'll have fewer riders dedicated to the lead-out train than Philipsen.
He said, however, that he expects Soudal-QuickStep to go all-in for the win on stage 1.
""The collaboration with Bert Van Lerberghe is something that works very well between us,"" he said of his lead-out man. ""But I expect the rest of the team to be there for us in the final.
""It will be a special Tour. The opening stage will be very important. The last time the first stage was for sprinters was a while ago. So, that will probably not be the case again in the future.""
First of all, though, the pair will be doing battle in Belgium, with the opening two stages looking primed to host a mass sprint finish ahead of the stage 3 time trial and hillier tests during the closing two stages.
""In principle, I don't need an extra victory for my confidence for the Tour de France, but I would like it. I give the best of myself in every race,"" Merlier said, while Philipsen said that a win would be a ""motivational boost"" in a race which gives him a chance to gauge himself against his rivals.
""A stage win is always the goal here and a motivational boost for what is to come. It is always an important race with a view to what is yet to come,"" he said.
""It's a nice race to see where you are and what your condition is with a view to the Tour. It's always good for your confidence if you can win here and get a good feeling.""

With the Critérium du Dauphiné and Tour de Suisse now done, the fight to remain in the WorldTour turns to theTour de France, where the most points of the season are on offer through stage wins, time in the leader's jersey and the final overall classification.
To date, UAE Team Emirates-XRG lead the way in both the 2023-2025 Team Rankings that will determine the top 18 teams eligible for the next three years of the WorldTour as well as the 2025 rankings, used to establish which ProTeams earn automatic invitations to the Grand Tours.
With their points piling as high as a hoarder's stash, the team of Tadej Pogačar have a lead of over 27,000 points across the past three years on second-placed Visma-Lease A Bike.
The difference between the two is more points than seven of the other WorldTour teams have scored in three years - shocking!
Behind Visma-Lease A Bike, Lidl-Trek are third in the hierarchy, just ahead of Soudal-QuickStep and Ineos Grenadiers.
Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe – predicted by many to be one of the top teams of the year – are lagging in sixth in the triennial rankings, with Alpecin-Deceuninck not far behind.

There's a big jump between the seventh-placed team of Mathieu van der Poel and the next teams. Groupama-FDJ, Bahrain Victorious and Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale are within 1,200 points of each other.
EF Education-EasyPost and Lotto are separated by less than 300 points in 11th and 12th, while Movistar, Israel-Premier Tech and Jayco-AlUla are sitting relatively comfortably in 13th, 14th and 15th, respectively.
Things get a bit more unstable as we get down to Intermarché-Wanty in 16th. They are soon to be overtaken by the rapidly advancing XDS Astana Team, who have climbed from 21st in the 2023-2024 rankings to now 17th in the three-year tally.
Intermarché-Wanty are 22nd in the 2025 UCI Team Rankings and will be praying that Biniam Girmay can come through during the Tour de France with a repeat victory in the green jersey competition.
XDS Astana's progress slowed over the past three weeks, although Diego Ulissi's win in the Giro dell'Appennino (and teammate Simone Velasco's third place) today shows the team aren't veering off their track.
The Kazakh team have a reinvigorated Team Picnic-PostNL hot on their heels, just 66 points behind in 18th place.
That leaves Cofidis sitting in the relegation zone along with Arkéa-B&B Hotels. Despite Kévin Vauquelin's second place in the Tour de Suisse, Arkéa are still 3,108 points behind Picnic-PostNL in 21st place and are at the most risk of being relegated.
Cofidis can still hold out hope that a strong Tour de France will be their salvation. They're just 352 points down on Picnic-PostNL and will be fighting for every possible opportunity to score in July.
Cofidis has a potentialcontender for the Tour de Francein Emanuel Buchmann – 11th in the Dauphiné – while Picnic-PostNL will be hoping that Oscar Onley can come through with a strong performance after his third place in the Tour de Suisse.
Almost as pressing as the WorldTour relegation fight is the battle between the ProTeams, as well as teams who get relegated, for the three automatic invitations to the 2026 Grand Tours for the top ProTeams of 2025.
After the first five months of the season, Israel-Premier Tech and Lotto are the top contenders to be promoted to the WorldTour in 2026 aftersuffering relegation in 2022, and Uno-X Mobility lead the way for the automatic invitations.
However, considering Lotto's utterly dismal season to date, there are numerous questions about their future.
Lotto wasn't able to hold onto most of their top riders in the 2024-2025 transfers, with Victor Campenaerts, Pascal Eenkhoorn, Maxim Van Gils, Florian Vermeersch, Mathijs Paasschens and Sylvain Moniquet all leaving for other WorldTour teams.
They also have staked most of their hopes on sprinter Arnaud De Lie, but has the pressure got to the 23-year-old? He has but a single victory this year - a stage of Etoile de Bessèges - after suffering from a knee injury and illness in the spring, and another crash at the Antwerp Port Epic earlier this month.
Yet Lotto are confident that De Lie will be a factor at the Tour de France.
""He'll be there,"" team manager Stéphane Heulot said this week. ""The timing's been close, but I'm delighted with his evolution in the last week. I've found the Arnaud again that I knew before. Motivated and determined. He's doing fine.""
With the team's results in 2023 and 2024, it would take a massive disaster for them not to stay in the top 18 and have the chance to be promoted - even if they do have the lowest points tally of any of the top 24 teams this year - they are still on track to finish well inside the top 18 at the end of the year in the 2023-2025 team rankings.
There is a chance that Lotto could choose not to step back up to the WorldTour and remain a ProTeam. It would give them far more flexibility in their calendar, but it would also mean they would have to be in the top three teams for 2025 to get automatic invitations to the Grand Tours and other WorldTour races.
Right now, that is not looking good for the Belgian outfit. They are light years behind the top ProTeams not likely to be promoted to the WorldTour: Uno-X Mobility, Tudor and Q36.5. If they want to be in the Tour de France next year, Lotto will be counting on promotion.
Q36.5, led by Tom Pidcock, benefited the most from the UCI's recent decision toextend the number of teams for Grand Tours and WorldTour stage races to 23and add a third team to the automatic invitation list.
They are high on the probability list to be in the Tour de France and all of the other WorldTour races next year.
Although they'll be top of the list for wildcards for the Tour de France, TotalEnergies aren't assured of anything for 2026. They have been only slightly less lacklustre than Lotto this year and are in a sticky situation among the ProTeams.
TotalEnergies are far behind Uno-X Mobility, Tudor and Q36.5, so automatic invitations aren't looking very assured for the French team.
Additionally, their title sponsor is reportedly close toinking a multi-million pound deal to support Ineos Grenadiers. Whether or not that means a merger between the two teams or joint sponsorship is yet unknown.
With more than half of the season behind us, the picture becomes a little clearer when it comes to what to expect for promotions and relegation.
Based simply on the average points scored per week, XDS Astana are on a path to overtake Intermarché-Wanty after the Tour de France.
Oscar Onley's third place overall in the Tour de Suisse and the team's fine Giro d'Italia have nudged Picnic-PostNl onto a path that closely parallels Cofidis' - if the status quo remains the German team should avoid being overtaken.
While averages aren't the only factor for predicting what the rankings will look like come October, they do show how close the margins can be for the WorldTour teams hoping to remain in the top 18.
Picnic-PostNL and Cofidis are separated by only 300 points, and that's one WorldTour one-day race victory away from reversing. The predicted margin between Intermarché-Wanty and Picnic-PostNL is even tighter. Even Jayco-AlUla aren't out of the woods, yet, although their lead over the lower-ranked teams looks more solid.
It will make theTour de Franceeven more thrilling and dangerous as the stakes are the highest that they've been since 2022.

'There's more at stake than just a Tour de France stage' - Dylan Groenewegen adds his name to riders targeting first yellow jersey in Lille,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/theres-more-at-stake-than-just-a-tour-de-france-stage-dylan-groenewegen-adds-his-name-to-riders-targeting-first-yellow-jersey-in-lille/,0.9968,"Dylan Groenewegen has thrown his hat into the ring of big-name sprinters targeting victory and the first yellow jersey on stage 1 of this year'sTour de Francein Lille.
TheJayco-AlUlarider recently returned to his powerful best, winning two stages at the Tour of Slovenia and so is growing in confidence as the days countdown to the Tour Grand Depart in northern France. The Tour begins on Saturday July 5 with a 184.9km stage around the Lille Métropole area before an expected high-speed sprint in the city centre.
Groenewegen expected sprint rivals in Lille includeTim Merlier(Soudal-QuickStep), Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek),Wout Van Aert(Visma-Lease a Bike), Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Arnaud De Lie (Lotto), three-time stage winner and 2024 green jersey winner Biniam Girmay (Intermarché-Wanty), Magnus Cort (Uno-X Mobility) and others.
The stage to Lille will be the most prestigious and important sprint of 2025.
""There's more at stake than just a Tour de France stage and as a sprinter you don't get that chance very often,"" Groenewegen told Dutchnational television channel Nosduring a relaxed pre-Tour interview on a boat near his home in the Netherlands.
""The last time was six years ago but I crashed then. Fortunately Mike Teunissen won and it was still a great day for us as a team but now I hope that I can do it myself.""
Groenewegen is now 32 and in his final year of his contract with Jayco-AlUla. He is not expected to stay with the Australian team as the sprinters' transfer market sparks a number of changes. However he will share team leadership with Ben O'Connor and target the numerous sprint opportunities in the first half of the 2025 Tour.

He has ridden the Tour seven times, finished all but one of them and won stages in five different editions, including two stages in 2018. His last was in 2024 in Dijon, when he beat Girmay.
""If I felt I was no longer good enough, I wouldn't even go there. I could think of a better holiday,"" Groenewegen said of the annual three weeks of suffering and intense racing in July.
""Of course, there's always a chance it won't work out, but we're going to try to turn that opening stage to our advantage. And then you have the yellow jersey as an extra reward.""
Whatever happens in Lille, the open week of the Tour across northern France offers chances for the sprinters and finisseur riders like Van Aert and Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck).
""I think there are two or three sprint chances in week one. It also depends on how the peloton is going to race,"" Groenewegen suggested.
Groenewegen has endured some difficult seasons since his double Tour stage win in 2018. He was suspended for nine months after he sparked Fabio Jakobsen's terrible crash at the2020 Tour de Pologne. He became a father in 2021 but then his young son faced some serious health problems.
Groenewegen always had the swagger and straight talking attitude of a successful sprinter but is now more mature.
""I'm calmer and because of the birth, more of a family person. We enjoy it even more that he is now completely healthy and is with us. And then I also enjoy winning races more,"" he said.
Groenewegen suffered concussion after a crash at the 2025 UAE Tour and another hard crash at Tirreno-Adriatico but he is now near his best.
""When you ride a spring like that, you also have some doubts but in recent weeks, the sprint is back to where it should be. The speed is there, the condition is there and the instinct is back to where it should be,"" he concluded."
'I’m gutted' – Stevie Williams to miss Tour de France and national championships as knee issue continues to disrupt his 2025 racing,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/im-gutted-stevie-williams-to-miss-tour-de-france-and-national-championships-as-knee-issue-continues-to-disrupt-his-2025-racing/,0.2303,"Stevie Williamshas revealed he will miss the Tour de France and the British national championships in Wales due to a knee problem.
""Since the start of my season in Australia, I’ve had an issue with my right knee, a quadriceps tendinopathy, which is very tricky to manage, and it hasn’t resolved,"" said Williams in a statementshared by his team on social media.
""I was able to come back for Giro d’Abruzzo and the Ardennes, but since then, things still aren’t completely right.""
Williams had a flying start to 2024, winning theSantos Tour Down Underin January and then La Flèche Wallonne in April, but while he managed to line up at both events in 2025 there was no sign that there would be any replicating his success.
After taking time out between Australia and Il Giro d'Abruzzo to treat his problem, Williams had warned that he would be returning without the same form. After the four-day Italian race he struggled at La Flèche Wallonne, Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Eschborn-Frankfurt before putting his racing on pause once again.
""As a cyclist, the only thing you want to do is race, so this season has been incredibly frustrating, but I know that these things can’t be rushed,"" said Williams.
The 29-year-old has had plenty of experience with the recovery process, having had to hit the pause button for more than a year when he suffered a serious knee injury soon after starting his WorldTour career with Bahrain Merida in 2019.His last race at Eschborn-Frankfurt was on May 1 but he will miss more of the season as the hiatus is set to continue.

""Unfortunately, this means I won’t be able to race the national championships in Wales or the Tour De France,"" said Williams.
""I’m gutted to miss them, especially racing Nationals in front of a home crowd. But, I’m working really hard to get back to full fitness with the support of the team and I hope I’ll be back on the start line soon."""
'Better on schedule than last year' – Remco Evenepoel 1.5kg lighter and sharpening for Tour de France at Dauphiné,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/better-on-schedule-than-last-year-remco-evenepoel-15kg-lighter-and-sharpening-for-tour-de-france-at-dauphine/,0.9984,"Remco Evenepoelheads into his final preparation race for theTour de France, the Critérium du Dauphiné, ""a step ahead of last year"" according to his Soudal-QuickStep team, after another crash-affected season where he willtake on Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard.
Last year, Evenepoel was ramping up for his first appearance in two months at the Dauphiné, having crashed and sustained fractures at Itzulia Basque Country. In 2025, it was thedooring incident in the off-season that put him out of action until Aprilwith several injuries, and his seen him searching for top form in anticipation of the Tour.
With just four days to go until the start of the prestigious eight-day stage race in France, Evenepoel's coach Koen Pelgrim is staying measured about the expectations of the Belgian, but gave a greater insight on a call toNieuwsbladand international media into how the Olympic Champion's form is shaping up.
""Remco is definitely better on schedule than last year. Then he started the altitude training camp for the Dauphiné with a disadvantage; he was struggling at the beginning of that training camp, and he was really not where we hoped he would be,"" said Pelgrim, reported byNieuwsblad.
""In that respect, he is already a step ahead of last year. After the accumulation of competitions in the spring, the week of rest really did him good, and he was able to start the altitude training camp at a pretty good level.""
Despite this positive development, after Evenepoelreturned with a bang at Brabantse Pijlin April, and had mixed results from Amstel Gold Race through to the Tour de Romandie where he was fifth, again, Pelgrim ensured he was realistic with his ambitions.
""He is now one step further than last season just before the Dauphiné. But last year, Remco improved a lot between the Dauphiné and the Tour. So we'll have to see if Remco is still in a better position at the start of the Tour,"" said the coach.

""He stayed off the bike for four months. You can't just make up for something like that. You can get back to a good level relatively quickly, but it's those last few percentage points that are crucial.
""For that, you have to be able to train consistently over a long period. We hope that Remco can gain those last two or three percentage points in the coming weeks. We cannot do magic.""
One area where Pelgrim has seen clear, measurable improvement was with Evenepoel's weight, already nearing the ideal race level for which the Belgian team were looking at the Tour's start on July 5.
""He is one-and-a-half kilos lighter than last year at this time of year,"" said Pelgrim, confirming that the tapering down has been more gradual than after last year's Dauphiné.
""When you have to lose a lot of weight in a short period, it always takes its toll on your strength, recovery or even both. That was the story of last year: we had to chase both his competition weight and his form. The fact that he doesn't have to do that anymore this year is positive.""
Evenepoel will be backed at the Dauphiné by Pascal Eenkhoorn, Valentin Paret-Peintre, Casper Pedersen, Pepijn Reinderink, Maximilian Schachmann and Louis Vervaeke, with the leader similarly not being overly bullish in pursuit of a top result againstPogačarand Vingegaard.
""I’m happy to be back in action with the team. I had a solid altitude training camp in Sierra Nevada and now I’m ready for the Dauphiné,"" said Evenepoel in a team release.
""I can’t say that I’m going there with any specific goals, as the most important thing will be to see how the form is. It goes without saying that I would like to be in the fight for a couple of good results, but the plan is to take it one stage at a time and see where this leads next week.""
With the Tour just around the corner, Evenepoel will hope he's closed the gap to the Slovenian and Dane, and that he can at least once again finish third at the Tour ,after a great debut in 2024. Pelgrim said this could still be his ceiling for the moment, against the respective three-time and two-time Tour champions.
“We always aim higher, but Pogačar's level was exceptionally high last year and closing that gap is very difficult. And Vingegaard will also be better now than last year,"" added the coach. ""So even though Remco has made a step, that does not mean that he will necessarily do better than third place.""

Tour de France: Unchained Series 3 review - A dramatic look back at the 2024 race in the final Netflix series,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/tour-de-france-unchained-series-3-a-dramatic-look-back-at-the-2024-race-in-the-final-netflix-series/,0.996,"The third and final Tour de France: Unchained Netflix series will be released on Wednesday, July 2, offering another dramatic and entertaining look back at the 2024 Tour de France in true Netflix documentary style.
Cyclingnewswas able to see the series a few days before the release date to write a review and description of what to expect and enjoy.
Season 3 consists of eight episodes of around 40 minutes that recall the story of the 21 stages of the2024 Tour de France. Netflix and series producer QuadBox again weave together television race footage, on-bike videos, team car conversations, body-cam footage and rider interviews to create a concentrated, dramatic and often over-the-top look at the Tour de France.
Former French rider Yoann Offredo and TNT presenter and journalist Orla Chennaoui present the narrative with carefully scripted comments interspersed among the action. Rider interviews are also revealing, even if many are shot post-race during the off-season.
There is again a focus on crashes and injuries but Tour de France: Unchained also captures the real tension in the teams and the tears and emotions of defeat.
The tactics and racing are sometimes simplified for a wider audience but despite that, the documentary is addictive and entertaining to watch, whatever your level of understanding of the sport, showing moments that are rarely seen on television or video.
For many cycling fans, Tour de France: Unchained will be fascinating, entertaining and addictive. We may know the narrative of the 2024 Tour and who won the individual stages and overall but the episodes add more details and complete the picture.
The latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!
Several major teams have released or promoted their own documentary videos recently but they only highlight the quality of the Tour de France: Unchained series. In comparison the more traditional, and perhaps more censored, team documentaries can appear stale and boring.
Sadly it is the final series, even while the Formula 1 series Drive to Survive and other Netflix sports documentaries continue to attract new and younger audiences. Some have suggested that this is due to Tour de France: Unchained being scripted for Netflix France and a French audience but whatever the reason, pro cycling has again lost out to rival sports.
The first two seasons of Tour de France: Unchained were released in early June but this year riders will already be in Lille for the 2025 Tour when the series becomes available. Some have criticised the later date but the benefit is that it makes Tour de France: Unchained a great way to look back to the 2024 race and get excited for 2025.
The 2024 Tour was a battle between Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) and Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and2025 is expected to be the same, with Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep), Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and the rest of the peloton playing a supporting role.

The opening episode of eight sets the scene for the Pogačar-Vingegaard duel over the three weeks of racing and sets up the rest of the series.
The French bias is clear in episode 1 called David v Goliath, as Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale directeur sportif Julien Jurdie says ""money is the name of the game"" as minor teams lament the difference in team budgets.
However, the episode then recalls Romain Bardet's win and first yellow jersey in Rimini on stage 1 and how Kévin Vauquelin (Arkéa-B&B Hotels) won in Bologna from the breakaway.
Episode 2 presents Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič as 'disruptors' to the Pogačar-Vingegaard dual and focuses on Evenepoel's first Tour stage win in the stage 7 time trial.
Episode 3 tells the story of Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale's early struggles as Felix Gall loses time and Sam Bennett struggles in the sprints.
New team manager Dominique Serieys tries to lift his riders but only seems out of touch with his riders and staff. It shows the pain of defeat and disappointment at the Tour and shines light on why Serieys subsequently shook up the team and brutally removed team founder and long-time manager Vincent Lavenu.
Episode 4 covers the gravel stage to Troyes before the first rest day. It reveals the full emotions at TotalEnergies asAnthony Turgis beats Tom Pidcock in the sprint. It also reveals new details and tension when Vingegaard refuses to work with Pogačar and Evenepoel to gain time on Roglič.
""I'm not allowed eh? C'mon,"" Vingegaard shouted when the three were on the attack, suggesting he had been told not to work by his directeur sportif.
Pogačar can be heard replying: ""fuck you!"" Evenepoel later suggested that ""sometimes you need balls to race, unfortunately, Jonas didn't have them today.""
Pogačar suggested he was scared but the Dane said: ""If I'd worked, I'm pretty sure I would have lost the Tour de France that day.""
It was a glimpse of the real intensity of the Pogačar-Vingegaard rivalry that will be on show again this year. There are often handshakes and smiles but both Pogačar and Vingegaard and their UAE Team Emirates-XRG and Visma-Lease a Bike teams desperately want to win and are incredibly competitive.
Episode 5 tells the story of Vingegaard's terrible crash at the Itzulia Basque Country and the mental and physical consequences. The Dane's tears and fears of dying were real as were his hesitation on the mountain descents. Netflix loves a fairytale ending and also shows Vingegaard's tears after he wins stage 11 in Le Lioran.
The episode follows Roglič's move from Visma to Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and how the arrival of Red Bull as the title sponsor raises the pressure on the Slovenian. The episode ends with Rogič quitting the Tour before stage 13 and returning home once again to lick his wounds with his family, eventually promising to return to the Tour in 2025.
""The dream to win the Tour keeps you going,"" Roglič says.
Tour de France: Unchained Netflix is not afraid to edit the Tour narrative to fit their telling. Episode 6 is called 'History Makers' and covers Mark Cavendish's emotional farewell and recording breaking 35th stage win on day 5, which dominates the episode, while also telling the story of Biniam Girmay's historic three wins and how he stops Jasper Philipsen from winning another green points jersey.
Episode 7 focuses on EF Education-EasyPost as Richard Carapaz fights for a stage victory and eventually wins on stage 17 to Superdévoluy. It also reveals the frustration of rival teams as Pogačar dominates yet again.
""Trying to beat Tadej Pogačar is like throwing yourself against a brick wall but we have to keep trying,"" team manager Jonathan Vaughters says.
The final episodes logically focus on the GC battle between Pogačar and Vingegaard, Evenepoel's fight for the podium and Pogačar's eventual three consecutive stage wins in the Alps and ultimate victory in Nice.
Vingegaard apologised to his team for struggling in the Alps, as Pogačar won again and again to extend his winning margin to 6:17.
""There'll always be a rider in a generation that comes around and it's him, it's wicked and beautiful to share time in the peloton with him and see it first hand,"" Cavendish says in admiration before the final credits begin to roll.

Who will win the 2025 Tour de France? Ranking the form of the favourites for the yellow jersey,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-de-france-2025/preview/,0.9999,"The start of the 2025Tour de Franceis just around the corner on Saturday July 5, with the last WorldTour preparation stage races at theCrtiérium du Dauphinéand Tour de Suisse in the rear-view mirror, and the final tune-ups at altitude camp now being completed.
The three big-name favourites for the Tour and the podium from last year's race,Tadej Pogačar(UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike), andRemco Evenepoel(Soudal-QuckStep), all showed themselves at the French race, the pecking order seemingly the same as last July.
Pogačar was a cut above in the mountains, netting three stage wins and the yellow jersey, but it was only Vingegaard's first race since March. A poor performance in the time trial for the Slovenian has left more than enough to expect a serious battle in July.
Can Remco Evenepoel improve and become a threat for more than third place? The young Belgian seems determined to try.
At the Tour de Suisse, Pogačar's key climbing domestique João Almeida proved he's still in flying form, mounting a thrilling comeback to snatch overall victory on the final stage, suggesting UAE's team will be more than up to the challenge.
Vingegaard's Tour team will similarly grow in strength, however, with Giro d'Italia champion Simon Yates, and Wout van Aert linking up with many of those from the Dauphiné to try and help the Dane claim a third maillot jaune.
A two-horse race between Pogačar and Vingegaard is still expected, having won the past five Tours between them, but other players have emerged at the recent stage races, and someone could be due a big step-up. But just how close are the rest of the opposition to upsetting the established hierarchy?
Here’sCyclingews' latest form guide to the contenders for the 2025 Tour de France.

Defending championTadej Pogačarwill once again start as the favourite for the Tour de France, with his performances in 2025 only continuing to leave him at the top of the pile of contenders for cycling's biggest race.
After his dominance at the 2024 race, Pogačar has only cemented his superiority over his rivals this season, most recently Jonas Vingegaard at the Critérium du Dauphiné. With three stage victories and his first overall title at the traditional pre-Tour form-marker, Pogačar is heading to the Tour in absolutely flying shape.
First came the surprise sprint win on day 1, ahead of the Dane out of a superstar breakaway, but his two mountain stage victories were much more significant. On return to Combloux, where Vingegaard dominated him in a time trial at the Tour de France two years prior, the world champion stamped his authority on the competition, putting 1:01 into Vingegaard after just a 20-minute climbing effort.
The next day, he surged away on the Queen stage to Valmeinier 1800, with enough in the tank to ease up at the line as Vingegaard seemingly worked much harder to try and just stay close. After a blip in the time trial, where he lost significant time to Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel, Pogačar confirmed that he would be starting this year's Tour as favourite, looking quite invincible on the high ground for now.
At just 26, Pogačar will be eyeing a fourth yellow jersey triumph in 2025, which would see him draw level with Chris Froome for the fifth most Tour GC wins of all time. Everything we've seen so far this season suggests that is the likely outcome if his rivals cannot close the large gap that was present at the Dauphiné.

For yet another year, Pogačar's biggest rival will beJonas Vingegaard. Winner of the Tour in 2022 and 2023, Vingegaard is one of the few riders who is able to beat Pogačar in Grand Tours, and he'll be trying to turn Pogačar's 3-2 lead at the Tour into a level score this July.
After the Dauphiné, where Vingegaard finished second to the Slovenian, he was definitely second fiddle to favourite Pogačar, but the eternal rivals look a lot closer than they were at this point in 2024, when Vingegaard was still on the road back from injury.
The Dane has still had the tougher run-in, suffering a concussion at Paris-Nice instead of racking up wins like Pogačar was in the spring, but at the Dauphiné, the pair were well-matched in terms of aggressiveness, but with Vingegaard still lacking something on the big climbs.
Vingegaard said after the Dauphiné that he thinks he still has room to improve, which may be wishful this close to the Tour, but isn't completely impossible, and he still has some reinforcements to join his team, like Giro winner Simon Yates and Wout van Aert.
Pogačar may be the more prolific winner, especially this year, but let's not forget that Vingegaard has beaten him in the Tour twice – it's certainly not impossible, and Pogačar definitely doesn't already have title number four sewn up.
Vingegaard will have to find something extra and hope to fatigue Pogačar as the race goes on, but he's still a contender to win this Tour and will be the second protagonist in the GC.

Having started the Critérium du Dauphiné saying his form was at a better place than it was this time last year,Remco Evenepoel's stock among the favourites perhaps dropped the most after his eight days of racing in France.
Despite starting well by getting into the late attack on stage 1 alongside Pogačar, Vingegaard and Mathieu van der Poel, and showing exactly why he's rated the best time trial rider in the world by dominating stage 4, Evenepoel's performances in the mountains would have been a disappointment.
He was clearly the third-best climber at last year's Tour, but this time, he was well away from the top two favourites, losing almost five minutes across the three final mountain stages. He was also outdone by young German Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), who prevented a repeat of the Tour podium forming at the Dauphiné.
The Dauphiné time trial will remain the highlight, with Evenepoel's big time gain on every rider putting him into yellow for a couple of days, and making the Tour's fifth stage to Caen against the clock a huge key to Evenepoel finishing among the top spots as he did on debut last year.
It's no crisis, with the Dauphiné's finale coming well in advance of the Grand Départ. He has time to improve, but the climbing legs will need significant improvement if he is to aim higher than third.
Evenepoel also potentially lost another domestique in Louis Vervaeke, with Mikel Landa already ruled out from his Giro crash. As it stands, Evenepoel's Tour support team will be the weakest among the favourites, hurting his chances further.

If the main question of this year's Tour is 'Who will win, Pogačar or Vingegaard?' there's also a secondary question: which of their domestiques will do best?
In recent years, it's become common to see UAE Team Emirates-XRG or Visma-Lease a Bike domestiques finish in the top 10 or even on the podium of Grand Tours, and that's not likely to change this year.The rider currently looking like they have the best shot of a top Tour finish is UAE'sJoão Almeida.
The Portuguese rider would be a Grand Tour leader at any other team, given he's finished in the top 10 no fewer than six times already, but here he will support Tadej Pogačar. However, that doesn't mean he can't also finish well, like he did last year, taking fourth, or like his teammate Adam Yates, who landed on the podium in 2023.
Almeida is fresh off of winning the Tour de Suisse, where he won three stages, and that was his third consecutive GC win of the year after victories at the Tour de Romandie and Itzulia Basque Country.
In fact, he's not finished lower than sixth in any of the six stage races he's done this year, so it's clear that the form is there. The question of how he ensures a high finish whilst also helping Pogačar may be tricky, but Almeida has done it before, and looks on track to do it again – it's not even implausible to see him leapfrogging Evenepoel and contending for the podium.

Primož Rogličwill start his seventh Tour de France as somewhat of an unknown, having not raced in either of the Dauphiné or Tour de Suisse, and with his last race appearance being a DNF at the Giro d'Italia. As has been the story for many of his Tour bids, a series of crashes in Italy led to Roglič abandoning the race, with his GC challenge up in smoke.
Had he won the Giro, his status as a 'favourite' would be different, but with another crash-out, and him looking well away from his previous Grand Tour champion best, the gap from Roglič to Pogačar and his former teammate Vingegaard only appears to have grown.
Roglič does still have his Grand Tour history, as a four-time Vuelta winner, Giro champion and famous former Tour runner-up, to push him high up this list, however, and if he can avoid the crashes and chaos, then he should be well in the running for at least the podium.
He's bounced back several times in his illustrious career at the Vuelta, after several DNFs from the Tour, so perhaps crashing out of the Giro will see him bounce back to his world-beating best at the Tour.
On his and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe's side, too, is the rapid rise ofFlorian Lipowitzinto one of the best GC prospects in the world, with the 24-year-old German looking set to start his first Tour as a key domestique and back-up GC option.
Only Pogačar and Vingegaard were better than him at the Dauphiné, and while a three-week race is vastly different to eight days, Lipowitz looks to have the tools required to contend at Grand Tours in the long term.

If João Almeida takes the title of second-best GC rider at UAE, that title goes toMatteo Jorgensonat Visma-Lease a Bike.
That may seem surprising, seeing as Grand Tour winners Sepp Kuss and Simon Yates are also in the line-up, but it's perhaps Jorgenson's hunger – as a rider who hasn't had a big result like that before – that could push him to a top finish this year. He finished eighth at the Tour last year, helping Vingegaard to second, and should be thinking about pushing that up a place or two this year.
Jorgenson won Paris-Nice for the second time in a row earlier this year, and after a strong but, results-wise, disappointing Classics campaign, went on to finish sixth at the Dauphiné, demonstrating again that he can finish well whilst also supporting Vingegaard.
More of a Grand Tour all-rounder than a pure climber, Jorgenson should seek to take advantage in the punchier stages and the two time trials, which should suit him well.
He'll have to climb better in the high mountains, but if he can work for Vingegaard and then pace himself to not lose too much time, he could definitely be on track for a top finish.
Kuss and Yates are purer climbers, which should mean they can do more of the mountain domestique work, giving the American a little more freedom to think about his own GC as well as Vingegaard's.

Movistar'sEnric Masmay not be the flashiest GC contender, nor will he be come the start of the Tour, but he remains one of the most consistent racers over three weeks in the peloton, and will start his seventh Tour on July 5.
The Spanish GC rider's best overall finish dates back to 2020, when he finished fifth, with his last three appearances ending in two DNFs and a 19th-place finish, but after all of those shortcomings, Mas followed it up with a top GC finish at La Vuelta a España.
In a similar fashion to Roglič, Mas will be hoping for good luck, and more importantly, his top-level to arrive in France, and his recent stage racing results suggest that the latter is on the way.
He too raced the Dauphiné, and while he was well away from the top favourites, he took seventh overall after a solid performance, with much of his time loss coming in the time trial. With only one flat race against the clock at the Tour, Mas should be able to focus his efforts on the mountain days and the uphill time trial on stage 13, which should suit his characteristics.
Grand Tour consistency has long been his biggest strength, and he'll need to show it again if he is to return to the Tour de France GC top six, as he did in 2020 and 2021. It will be close between him and Carlos Rodríguez for the top Spanish finish.

Ben O'Connoris heading to the Tour with big ambitions, but perhaps not the results to place him as far up the list of contenders as he'd probably like to be. The Australian is back targeting the Tour after racing the Giro and Vuelta last year and finishing fourth and second in those races, respectively.
Having moved to Jayco AlUla in the off-season, part of that decision was surely to have undisputed, well-supported leadership at the Tour, so there are big expectations on O'Connor's shoulders – from himself and externally.
Unfortunately, his results so far this year have not been as good as they were last year. He missed out on the top 10 in both Paris-Nice and the Volta a Catalunya, where many of his Tour rivals outperformed him, and whilst he did take seventh at the Tour de Suisse last week, he looked a step below the likes of winner Almeida.
O'Connor is certainly strong enough to finish on the podium of a Grand Tour; he's proven that already, but if he's not quite firing on all cylinders, especially against the quality at this race, he may find himself settling for a maximum top 10 this July.
O'Connor's best Tour result is, of course, his fourth from 2021, where a breakaway stage win saw him rise up the ranking, and close out the third week strong enough to stay up there. On his return to the Tour, and after his successes last year, he'll be eyeing up the top five.

With the Tour GC contenders mostly converging at the Dauphiné, the Tour de Suisse hasn't affected this list as much as it may have in previous years, but one rider whose stock it did raise wasFelix Gall(Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).
The Austrian climber, back at the race where he fully announced himself to the WorldTour with a stage win two years ago, was one of the top performers, finishing fourth overall and with five stage top 10s out of eight.
His best performance was second on the final mountain time trial, where he beat everyone but the overall winner João Almeida, suggesting the Tour's race against the clock up to Peyragudes will be a big day for Gall to show off his strengths.
After he won that Suisse stage in 2023, Gall went on to break through at his debut Tour de France by finishing eighth overall and winning one of the hardest mountain stages of the race to Courchevel, conquering the brutal Col de la Loze in the process.
Gall, unlike some who finished above him on GC in Switzerland, or possibly looked stronger at the Dauphiné, is higher up this list of favourites, mainly as he has the experience of finishing in the top 10 of a Grand Tour overall previously. Still just 27, he's got more potential yet to unlock.

Once the dominating team of the Tour de France, Ineos Grenadiers head to this race without a clear podium contender, and will instead likely look to former fifth-place finisherCarlos Rodríguezas their leader.
2018 Tour winnerGeraint Thomasis set to make his final Tour appearance, and while he left the Tour de Suisse early due to a crash, he always liftd his game for the Grand Tours, shown as recently as last year's Giro, where he finished third.
Rodríguez has racked up various big stage wins over the last couple of years and also cemented himself as a consistent top-10 finisher in stage races, including seventh and 10th in the Tour and Vuelta last year, after fifth at the Tour in 2023.
This year, he's finished top 10 in three of the four stage races he's done this year, most recently ninth at the Dauphiné, and he's likely to finish around that spot in the Tour, too.
Thomas could still be a back-up GC option, but more likely will fit into a support role, alongside riders like Laurens De Plus and Michal Kwiatkowski.

Mattias Skjelmoseis a rider whose place on this list has been up for debate over the last few weeks. Winner of the Amstel Gold Race and fifth in the Vuelta a España last year, a couple of months ago the Dane was looking on a good path towards the Tour, but illness and injury has derailed his run-in, forcing him out of the Dauphiné and then also the back-up Tour de Suisse.
Until last week, he hadn't raced since Liège-Bastogne-Liège, but he returned to action on Sunday at the Andorra MoraBanc Clàssica, not only taking part but winning the race in an uphill sprint. That win demonstrates that he's not lost all his form through illness, and could come good at just the right time for the Tour's key mountain stages, so given his previous achievements, he just about sneaks back into the list of contenders.
Skjelmose won't have much climbing support throughout the three weeks, however, with significant Lidl-Trek resources being allocated to helping Jonathan Milan contest the sprints against Tim Merlier and Jasper Philipsen. This could see him isolated in comparison to those ranked higher.

Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard cross paths in Sierra Nevada as they step up Tour de France preparation at high-altitude training camps,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/tadej-pogacar-and-jonas-vingegaard-cross-paths-in-sierra-nevada-as-they-step-up-tour-de-france-preparation-at-high-altitude-training-camps/,0.9743,"Tour de Francefavourites and rivalsTadej PogačarandJonas Vingegaardhave stepped up their preparations for the July Grand Tour, with the pair both heading to high altitude in Spain's Sierra Nevada mountain range this week.
Footage posted on social media showed the winners of the past five Tours training separately but in the same region of southern Spain. For at least the next two weeks, the two rivals will perhaps cross paths in the ski resort and be able to see each other train, while staying at a distance in different apartments with their teams.
Onevideoshowed reigning champion Pogačar racing alone up a 6% gradient at 2,200 metres of altitude, while anothervideoshowed 2022 and 2023 winner Vingegaard riding at altitude alongside a Visma-Lease A Bike teammate.
The duo are both spending time at altitude before they return to racing in June for their final Tour de France preparation race, theCritérium du Dauphiné(June 8-15).
So far in 2025, Vingegaard has taken on a very limited racing schedule, with only a successful trip to the Volta ao Algarve and a crash-abridged Paris-Nice on his calendar. His time in France was cut short by a fall and subsequent concussion, with the injury also seeing him miss a scheduled trip to the Volta a Catalunya in March.
He is training at altitude alongside several teammates, including Matteo Jorgenson,Sepp Kuss, Victor Campenaerts, and Tiesj Benoot.
Pogačar, meanwhile, has enjoyed a dominant start to his campaign, taking seven wins in 14 race days to date, including the UAE Tour, Strade Bianche,Tour of Flanders, La Flèche Wallonne, and Liège-Bastogne-Liège.

He has UAE Team Emirates-XRG teammate Julius Johansen for company in Spain. It's a busy time for training camps in Sierra Nevada at the moment, withVelofactscompiling a list of teams and riders currently in the area.
Along with Vingegaard and Pogačar, TotalEnergies (including Matthieu Burgaudea and Matteo Vercher), EF Education-EasyPost (including Michael Valgren, Ben Healy, andNeilson Powless), and Lidl-Trek (Mattias Skjelmose and Toms Skujinš) are also in Sierra Nevada.
Of the other favourites for the Tour,Primož Roglič(Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) is currently racing the Giro d'Italia, where he lies second overall after four days of racing, whileRemco Evenepoel(Soudal-QuickStep) recently announced the start of his Tour preparation with a69km training ridein Belgium. He is expected to head to altitude very soon.
For many teams, the altitude camps are an important moment on the road to the Tour de France. They will then ride theCritérium du Dauphinéor the Tour de Suisse, in June before the big shown down in July.
Several teams and riders – including the big two – will head back to altitude after theCritérium du Dauphinéto put the final touches on their preparation for the Tour before the Grand Départ in Lille on Saturday July 5.
Vingegaard and Visma will head to Tignes in the French Alps for that final spell at altitude, while UAE have yet to confirm Pogačar's plans. Last year, he headed to Isola 2000 in the Italian Alps before heading to the Tour.
The Tour de France will begin in 53 days but the hard work and vital training has already begun."
Jonas Vingegaard says race doctor 'never once checked me for a concussion' after Paris-Nice crash,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/jonas-vingegaard-says-race-doctor-never-once-checked-me-for-a-concussion-after-paris-nice-crash/,-0.993,"Jonas Vingegaardhas spoken at length for the first time about theconcussionhe suffered at Paris-Nice in March, with the Dane calling for a rethink of cycling's concussion protocol.
The two-time Tour de France winner is preparing for this year's race at aVisma-Lease A Biketraining camp at altitude in Sierra Nevada, Spain, but he took time out from training for a press conference in which he discussed his spring-altering crash, and its after-effects in detail.
Vingegaard revealed that he was allowed to ride on during stage 5 without being checked for a concussion by the race doctor. He was only diagnosed with a concussion after finishing the stage, and he pulled out of the race the next day.
""I went to the race doctor because I had some blood on my face. I was bleeding, but they never once checked me for a concussion, which I find a bit odd, to be honest,"" Vingegaard said.
""It was visible that my glasses were broken, I had blood on my face, and I even had a little bit of blood here on the eyebrow. For me, that was a bit odd that they didn't check me for a concussion.""
Cycling's currentconcussion protocoladvises that riders should undergo a rapid assessment following a crash, followed by a check-up after the race and another the next day.
Spoke about his recovery from the concussion, recalling how he suffered a setback after attempting a short ride early in the process.

""I think, speaking more for the future, as soon as someone has something on the shoulders or above which is visible, they should check them for concussion before they can continue,"" he said.
""Of course, maybe the medical car was not there yet, but once I go to the medical car, they should at least check me when they can see that I hit my face.""
Vingegaard was forced to miss the Volta a Catalunya due to his concussion and spent nine days off the bike as a result. He'll return to racing at the Critérium du Dauphiné next month, facing off againstTadej Pogačarbefore the pair resume their Tour rivalry in July.
Addressing his recovery from the concussion, the Dane recalled how he suffered a setback after attempting a short ride early in the process.
""I went home the day after my crash in Paris-Nice, and I had to take it easy. When I had been awake for an hour or so, I had to sleep for an hour for the first three or four days. I was really suffering at the start, but every day was getting a bit better,"" Vingegaard said.
""By Monday, I was thinking 'OK, I can try to get on the bike again', just one hour of a recovery ride, which backfired pretty much.
""I had to lie down and sleep again, and I didn't touch my bike for four days again. Friday or Saturday was my first ride, and from there I've been increasing the workload.""
It's the second season in a row which has seen Vingegaard's spring disrupted thanks to a crash.
Last year, ahigh-speed multi-rider crash at Itzulia Basque Countrypitched him into a race against time to recover for the Tour. He said that this year's crash, which he called ""maybe the most stupid crash I've ever had"", wasn't as serious, occurring at a far lower speed.
""Last year I had this nasty crash in Basque, and didn't have the optimal preparation for the Tour de France,"" he said.
""This year, I crashed again in the spring and had to take a week off, so I feel like I missed out on the whole spring campaign. So, I have more motivation to go to theTour de France, to the races that are coming up now, and to do the work that's needed.
""It's not really comparable because last year I crashed because of the bad roads, and we were going very fast on the downhill. This year at Paris-Nice, it was maybe the most stupid crash that I've ever had.
""I think we were going uphill, and one guy in front of me overlapped the wheel, and I couldn't do anything. We were basically going 10-15kph. It didn't really bring back any memories because it was so different.""
Vingegaard admitted that he's ""not on my best level yet"" ahead of the Dauphiné and Tour. He has hopes to find better form than he has previously, even if he's won the race twice.
After the Tour, he'll head to the Vuelta a España, while a debut at the UCI RoadWorld Championships in Rwandais also possible. Danish national coach Michael Mørkøv has said that Vingegaard will head to Rwanda, but the man himself stopped short of confirming his participation.
""I know at this moment that I'm not on my best level yet, but that's what I'm here for,"" he said of the Tour. ""Hopefully, I can be even better than I have ever been before. If I'm better than I've ever been before, I'm pretty sure that then I can at least fight for the victory in the Tour de France.
""I've always been interested in the World Championships. I still am, and, as I've said before, it depends on how I come out of the Vuelta. But, for now, it's in my head."""
'Hugely disappointing' – David Gaudu joins Benoît Cosnefroy in announcing he will miss Tour de France,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hugely-disappointing-david-gaudu-joins-benoit-cosnefroy-in-announcing-he-will-miss-tour-de-france/,0.9978,"Leading French GC contenderDavid Gauduhas confirmed that he will be missing theTour de Francethis year due to poor form.
The Groupama-FDJ leader is the second top French name to announce this week he will not be taking part in his home Grand Tour after one-day specialistBenoît Cosnefroy(Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) already said earlier this week he would not be taking part in either the Nationals or the Tour because of an ongoing knee injury.
Fourth in the Tour de France back in 2022and ninth in 2023, Gaudu had been set for his eighth Tour participation this July and was expected to be one of the key home names to watch in the upcoming race.
However, after former Tour de France podium finisherRomain Bardet (Picnic-PostNL) already announced he was retiring from road racingafter one last Dauphiné in June, Gaudu, 28, will be another familiar French face missing from the running come July.
""Given my current level, I've been honest with the team. In any case, they have my data and we've decided together to miss out on the Tour this year,"" he toldAFP.
""To race just to finish, there's no point in that.""
Being on the start line in Lille on July 5 would have meant Gaudu would be taking part in his second Grand Tour of 2025. He took 66th in the Giro d'Italia this May, and barring being in a couple of breaks to no lasting effect, he barely featured in the race action. He finished the Giro, as he put it toAFP, ""completely exhausted.""
The latest race content, interviews, features, reviews and expert buying guides, direct to your inbox!
As for missing out on the Tour, ""It's hugely disappointing,"" he said. ""Particularly as the race goes through Britanny this year and my relatives were going to come see me there.""
After an early triumph in the Tour of Oman boded well for the rest of the season, Gaudu explained that he has been chasing form all year, with four crashes so far this season and a fractured hand injury in Tirreno-Adriatico making his season much more complicated.
""I held back on a decision until the last weekend to do a training camp, do some mountain climbs and exercises off the bike. But my feelings still aren't good,"" Gaudu said.
Gaudu's non-participation comes hard on the heels of the news that another top French racer, allrounder and one-day specialist Benoît Cosnefroy (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) will also be missing the Tour.
The former GP de Québec and Bretagne Classic-Ouest France winner crashed and injured his knee on stage 1 of the latest edition of the Tour de Suisse.
While France has lost two of its top names for its home Grand Tour, Gaudu's missing his country's biggest race is just the latest non-participation drama for Groupama-FDJ to handle. Earlier this week, it was announced that Swiss time trial and Classics specialistStefan Küngwould not be taking part in the upcoming Championships, where he is defending TT champion, because of a training crash.
As for Gaudu, it remains to be seen how he will salvage something from the season. Last year, he finished sixth in the Vuelta a España, where he also won two stages in 2020, and – although the rider has said nothing so far in that regard – it hasn't yet been ruled out that he will return to the Spanish Grand Tour this August.
Longer-term, when Gaudu re-signed for Groupama-FDJ this spring until the end of 2027, he said the next two seasons would be his last ones as a team leader.
Meanwhile, Groupama-FDJ will aim for a top ten on GC and a stage win with their new signing for 2025,Guillaume Martin, who recently finished 10th overall in the Critérium du Dauphiné, said team boss Marc Madiot.
""Like many teams in the 'soft underbelly' of the World Tour peloton, our main goal is to secure a stage victory,"" the veteran manager toldCyclism'Actu. ""Then, to be as close as possible to the best, especially with Guillaume Martin.
""We have a good, cohesive team, and we hope to achieve good results, continuing what we showed at the Tour de Suisse. By combining the lessons learned from the Dauphiné and the Tour de Suisse, we should be well equipped.
""Guillaume is a very good stage racer. He asserts himself over time and with the wear and tear of the peloton. He perfectly met our expectations this week in the Dauphiné. He may not be a very spectacular rider at first glance, but he's tenacious and mentally very strong. He never gives up. I'm certain he'll bring us great satisfaction in the Tour de France.""

"'Not everything breaks with noise, sometimes it just slips out of rhythm' – Mattias Skjelmose to skip Tour de Suisse after illness",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/not-everything-breaks-with-noise-sometimes-it-just-slips-out-of-rhythm-mattias-skjelmose-to-skip-tour-de-suisse-after-illness/,0.9814,"Little seems to be running to plan forMattias Skjelmoseas he heads ever closer to theTour de France, where he will be lining up to try and bolster Lidl-Trek's GC showing this July after having proven his mettle at La Vuelta a España in 2024 with fifth.
The 24-year-old may have taken a spectacular victory at Amstel Gold Race ahead of Tadej Pogačar and Remco Evenepoel in April but there have been a number of challenges through the rest of the season.
""This season has been a quiet lesson in patience,"" said Skjelmose in a statement from the rider shared by Lidl-Trek. ""Not everything breaks with noise, sometimes it just slips out of rhythm. That’s what this stretch has felt like. It’s been frustrating, yes. But I’ve learned to listen, not rush. To recalibrate without losing sight of the road ahead.""
The bumps in the road travelled so far this season have included acrash which ended his podium chase at Paris-Nicein March, another which ended his La Flèche Wallonne before giving way to illness that altered his plans to line up at the Critérium du Dauphiné and now also the race that was meant to replace it,Tour de Suisse.
""This isn’t the first time things haven’t gone to plan and it won’t be the last,"" said Skjelmose. ""But being honest about where I stand doesn’t make me any less committed. If anything, it makes the goal even clearer. The Tour de France is still the priority and I’m fully focused on being ready.""
Skjelmose last raced the Tour de France in 2023, finishing 29th overall on his debut at the race and, while building to the Giro d'Italia had been the plan for 2025 at one point, by January it was announced that the Tour would be his goal.
The race build was meant to begin at the Critérium du Dauphiné, which is currently underway, but that was before an untimely illness at the end of altitude camp left him ""with a stomach infection,"" and ""no real ability to eat or recover properly.""

It had been thought that the Dane would be back to start the Tour de Suisse – which he won in 2023 – from June 15 to 22.
""A few days ago, I shared that I’d been off the bike for about a week with a stomach infection, but that I was back training and starting to rebuild my strength and rhythm,"" said Skjelmose. ""Not long after, the illness came back – more intense than before – but fortunately it passed quickly. We’ve done a number of tests and are still waiting on some results to get a clearer picture of what’s been going on.
""After speaking with the team and my coach, we made the call not to race Tour de Suisse. There just isn’t enough time to get back to the level I want to be at.

Cobbled Montmartre climb added to Tour de France final stage after Paris Olympics success,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cobbled-montmartre-climb-added-to-tour-de-france-final-stage-after-paris-olympics-success/,0.9895,"The final stage of the 2025Tour de Francein Paris will include a visit to the Montmartre hill and the Sacré-Cœur church, covering the roads that were packed with crowds for the road races during theParis Olympics.
Tour de France organisers ASO have confirmed the decision in a brief statement, with full details of the stage revealed to be on May 21. The stage is still expected to finish on the Champs-Élysées but the cobbled climb to Montmartre will add an extra twist.
""To mark the 50th anniversary of the first final finish on the Champs-Élysées, and one year after the excitement and cheers of the Paris 2024 Olympic road race, the peloton will return to the capital on a route that passes through the heights of Montmartre,"" ASO said.
""Riders will climb the Montmartre hill and pass beneath the Sacré-Cœur before battling it out on a stage that may break from the traditions established over the past 50 years in the heart of the capital.""
The Tour de France first finished on the Champs-Élysées in 1975, after spells at the Parc des Princes and the Cipale velodrome.
The final stage is often a celebratory parade, before the fast and furious laps of the Champs-Élysées and a sprint finish.
The 2024 Tour de France finished in Nicedue to the Paris Olympics but this year's stage will start in Mantes-la-Ville and cover approximately 120km before the finish in the centre of the French capital.

ASO have worked with local authorities to ensure the safety of the race, so that the bigger peloton can race on the narrow cobbled streets of Montmartre.
During the Olympics, an estimated 500,000 packed the roads of Montmartre, sparking safety concerns. These have been resolved, allowing the creation of the new look Paris circuit.

The Visma-Lease A Bike Tour de France squad are currently putting the final touches on their training for the Grand Tour at altitude in the Alps. The team is staying in Tignes once again were spotted tackling the key climb of the Col de la Loze during a stage 17 recon ride on Sunday.
Vingegaard is named as the Visma-Lease A Bike GC leader. Giro d’Italia winner Simon Yates is also in the squad behind Vingegaard as he takes on the Tour for the eighth time in his career. 2023 Vuelta a España winner Sepp Kuss is also back in the team, racing his fifth Tour.
Fellow American Matteo Jorgenson, who finished eighth at last year’s race, will be a key cog in the support team for Vingegaard, who won the Tour in 2022 and 2023 before finishing second to Tadej Pogačar in the past two editions.
A trio of Belgians are also in the Dutch squad, with nine-time Tour stage winner Wout van Aert lining up for seventh time. Tiesj Benoot and Victor Campenaerts also make the cut, the latter making his Tour debut for Visma. Van Aert is expected to target some of the rolling stages in the first week and perhaps even the first yellow jersey in Lille on stage 1.
Edoardo Affini is the final rider to make the squad, the Italian time trial specialist and rouleur making his Tour de France debut this summer, replacing Christophe Laporte.

“With these eight very strong riders, we believe in the plan we made for the Tour de France,” Niermann said.
“From day one, we will have to be there as a team to optimally assist Jonas in the GC. In addition, there will be opportunities for several riders to go for stage wins. We are very deliberately focused on ourselves and our own plan.
“We have an optimal preparation behind us, and with that, we think we can get the best possible result.”
Laporte has raced each of the past 10 editions of the Tour but has suffered from cytomegalovirus this season. The 32-year-old hasn’t raced since winning Paris-Tours last October, and the unpredictable nature of the virus, plus the long recovery time, means a comeback to the peloton has yet to be confirmed.
“Unfortunately, he’s been out for a while. He’s already missed the entire Classics campaign, and he won’t be fit for the Tour,” Niermann said back in May.
“We hope he’ll get back in shape and be able to train as quickly as possible. But, for the moment, he’s not 100% yet.”
The team will again race in a new switch-out kit for the Tour in order to avoid a clash with the Tour de France leader's yellow jersey. The Visma-Lease a Bike women's team will also wear the jersey at the Tour de France Femmes.
Following previous Tour designs inspired by Dutch Masters artists, a theme park, and the ‘power of the beehive’ at this year’s Tour of Flanders, the 2025 Tour jersey is named ‘the swarm’ and features thick black and yellow stripes as well as the names of thousands of fans who pre-ordered the jersey back in April.

TotalEnergies logo to appear on Ineos Grenadiers jersey for Tour de France in workaround of UCI title sponsor rules,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/totalenergies-logo-to-appear-on-ineos-grenadiers-jersey-for-tour-france-in-workaround-of-uci-title-sponsor-rules/,0.9971,"TheTotalEnergieslogo will appear on theIneos Grenadiersteam jersey for the 2025Tour de Franceas part of a sponsorship deal that will boost the British team's budget for 2025 and beyond after a solution was found to workaround the UCI sponsorship rules.
Cyclingnews has been told that the new jersey could be revealed on Tuesday July 1 as the team travels to Lille for the Grand Depart of the Tour de France.
L'Équipesplashed the news on Thursday morning after months of reports and rumours that Ineos and TotalEnergies were working on a deal. The French newspaper also reported that TotalEnergies will become the official 'energy' partner of the Tour de France and the Tour de France Femmes until 2028, as they invest significantly in professional cycling. TotalEnergies confirmed that agreement and said they would be part of the Tour publicity caravans.
A TotalEnergies merger with Ineos was never likely and Cyclingnews understands the Ineos set-up will remain as a British-registered team for financial and contract reasons.
UCI rules do not allow teams with the same main partner or title sponsor to compete in the same race, so TotalEnergies would not be allowed to become an official title sponsors or part of the official Ineos team name.
However they can become a simple, if big budget, jersey sponsor at Ineos as announced. For example, Red Bull appears on the arms of the Tudor Pro Cycling team jersey and also appear on different riders' helmets as well as being the title sponsor of the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team.
TotalEnergies confirmed the Ineos deal, Tour sponsorship and that they would continue their sponsorship of the TotalEnergies French ProTeam managed by Jean-René Bernaudeau until at least the end of 2026.

""As has been the case since 2016, we will be supportingJean-René Bernaudeau's team, to whom we have already confirmed our support for 2026 and our intention of opening up discussions for 2027, once the Tour de France is over,"" President-Director General of Total Energies Patrick Pouyanné said.In the same statement, TotalEnergies explained the commercial sponsorship deal with Ineos, highlighting how internal regulations and UCI control would avoid any cross team influence or interference.
""Furthermore, given the strong industrial relationship between Ineos and TotalEnergies on an international level, particularly with regard to the petrochemical Amiral project in Saudi Arabia, we are making official our sponsoring of the maillot with Ineos Grenadiers from the Tour de France 2025 onwards,"" TotalEnergies said.""TotalEnergies confirms that the agreements with the two teams are strictly commercial and exclude any influence or interference in terms of sporting relations or race strategies.""The team will have internal regulations guaranteeing this separation, as well as the full and entire independence of both teams, overseen by the UCI and respecting its rules.""
Escape Collective'sChris Marshall Bell first reported in March that TotalEnergies could come on board as a sponsor and in MayThe Timesclaimed that ""a merger is nearing completion.""
Ineos has recently boosted its backroom staff with a French-speaking partnerships manager, a number of French riders have also been linked to the team for 2026 but rider recruitment appears to be on hold until after July 1, when team management and rider agents will arrive at the Tour de France Grand Depart. The TotalEnergies sponsorship could give Ineos more funds to spend for their 2026 roster.
Remco Evenepoel has been linked to a high-profile transfer to Ineos Grenadiers for 2026, perhaps indicating the team's intentions to step up their Tour de France ambitions thanks to new sponsorship from TotalEnergies. Ineos is investing £2.5 billion in a new chemicals plant near Antwerp and employs 3150 staff across 12 R&D and production sites.
Ineos Grenadiers hired a sports marketing agency to hunt for a major sponsor that could contribute around £20 million in funding to ensure the team has a budget that can compete with UAE Team Emirates, Lild-Trek, and other super teams.
""It's fair to say that Ineos don't want to spend more money,"" team manager John Allert admitted in January when asked byCyclingnews.
""They very clearly do want us to be a super team and they know what it takes to be a super team. I'm not going to put a number on that, but it's a number that's greater than what we're currently spending.""
A sponsor since 2016, TotalEnergies had a notably successful 2024 Tour de France, claiming a stage win withAnthony Turgis on the gravel stage to Troyes.Turgis beat Ineos Grenadiers' Tom Pidcock in the sprint.
The Ineos Grenadiers' Tour team is expected to include Carlos Rodríguez as their GC leader, while Filippo Ganna expected to shine in the time trials. 2018 Tour winner Geraint Thomas is expected to be part of the eight-rider squad before retirement in the autumn and a management role at the team.

Who is the best men's Tour de France rider of the last 15 years? The Cyclingnews editors weigh in,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/editors-roundtable-who-is-the-best-mens-tour-de-france-rider-of-the-last-15-years/,0.9999,"If there's one thing we as cycling journalists – and as fans – like to do, it's debate. Whether it's a way to while away hours in a car at a Grand Tour, or to entertain ourselves on the roadside whilst we wait for the peloton to pass, chewing over arbitrary questions is always a fun activity.
Some favourites that always spark debate: which riders arereallyin the Big 3? Is Tadej Pogačar as good as Eddy Merckx? Is it boring when one person wins all the time? The discussions can be endless, and are one of the best things about being a sports fan.
So, before the 2025Tour de Francestirs up even more debates and debacles, we atCyclingnewswanted to have a little debate of our own. Don't worry, we didn't pick the kind of controversial question that would make this story 6,000 words long, but instead got thinking about a reflection on the current era of pro cycling, and who could be named the best Tour de France rider since 2010.
You may already have someone in mind, reading that question, and you may think it's obvious, but actually, there's a whole host of riders who could be put forward for that accolade (no, we didn't all say Tadej Pogačar).
We gathered around our virtual CN roundtable, and here are our picks. What do you think? Did we forget anyone? Is anyone painfully wrong, or magically spot on? Do let us know your thoughts down in the comments, and join in our discussion as we patiently wait for the Tour to get underway.

Mark Cavendishis the best Tour de France rider of the last fifteen years for me. Due to a spectacular relationship with the Tour that saw him win 35 stages from 2008 through to 2024, ultimately breaking Eddy Merckx's outright Tour de France individual stage wins record. It’s a staggering achievement, riders dream of winning a single Tour stage, to win 35 is completely off the charts.
Cavendish drew criticism at times during his career, especially as a fiery young sprinter. But the passion, commitment and talent it takes to consistently win at the world's hardest race for that amount of time is incredible. Only a very special cyclist would ever have been able to do it; it’s an achievement that I don’t think cycling fans should underestimate.

When Cavendish won his final, record-breaking Tour stage last year, many riders patted him on the back or offered congratulations after the finish line. The peloton showed its respect to the outright stage record holder. The Tour is over 100 years old, but Cavendish made history over the last fifteen years and did something that no rider before him has been able to do.

Looking at the very recent history of the Tour, Tadej Pogačar is the obvious pick with three overall wins and 17 stages, but, reaching back to 2010, I'm going to pick a rider who has made an impact on a larger number of Tours.
That man isPeter Sagan, who won 12 stages and picked up a record-breaking seven green jerseys between 2012 and 2019. The Slovakian was unbeatable in the battle for the points classification during that time, usually having the green jersey in the bag well before the race reached Paris.
Sagan, who was also a cobbled Classics star, was more versatile than the other top sprinters of that period, a precursor to current versatile sprinters including Mathieu van der Poel, Wout van Aert, and Mads Pedersen. On tough stages when his rivals were stuck in the gruppetto, he was able to strike out in the breakaway and add vital intermediate sprint points to his tally.
With 130 stages spent in green – 41 more than any other rider in history – Sagan relegated the likes of Mark Cavendish, André Greipel, Marcel Kittel, and Alexander Kristoff into second place on numerous occasions. The only blot on his record was in 2017, when he was disqualified after causing a multi-rider crash late on stage 4.
Since Sagan's last green five years ago, no other rider has won more than one, and it certainly doesn't look like any riders will get close to his seven jerseys anytime soon.

For me,Wout van Aertis the best Tour rider in recent memory. No, he's never won the race, but he's had a breadth of success that really no one can compare to. Not many riders have won a Ventoux stage, a time trial and the Champs-Élysées sprint, but Van Aert has – all in one Tour!
As well as winning nine stages and the green jersey, Van Aert has also helped Jonas Vingegaard to two overall victories and, despite what a certain Netflix documentary might want to convince you of, he's an incredibly committed and proud teammate, who can go from winning one day to giving it all for his leader the next.
Other riders may have won more, or on a bigger scale, but in my eyes, no one has been more impressive on such a variety of stages. And all whilst being one of the best Classics riders of a generation, too. Wout van Aert can do everything, and in an era where the cycling world celebrates multi-discipline success so highly, Van Aert is surely the best at being good in any situation or stage you throw at him.

The last 15 years basically encompass my full tenure as a full-blown road cycling fan. Looking back, I thought about who I was most excited to watch at the time, but if I’m being totally honest, I was never really that fussed about who won, either on a particular stage or the race as a whole.
Yes, Cav was brilliant, and I adored watching Thomas Voeckler try and cling onto the yellow jersey, but on reflection, it was Pinot who I missed most upon his retirement, and his was perhaps the only career I genuinely mourned the loss of.
A heady mix of hope and sadness that cut through the formulaic, scientific race scene like a dagger to the heart. He made me feel things as a fan that no other rider did, not because he won, but because maybe he could have. Sport is ultimately entertainment, and for cycling fans, there is simply no better storyline than a lovely, plucky Frenchman who very nearly made it.

To be honest, my first choice was to pick out a team domestique at random and call them 'the best Tour rider'. That was purely because even if we do have live TV coverage from start to finish now, in the first two-thirds of the stage, these team workers are still the ones who put in the mostly unrecognised hard yards, ministering to the leader's every need and so on. A crucial role, but they rarely garner more than a few words of suspiciously generic thanks from the winner – and that's when the team win. Every day that happens, there are 20 or so teams with nothing to celebrate, and the team workers still have to clock on as usual. Yet without them, the Tour wouldn't happen.
Then I remembered about Geraint Thomas.
For years since his first Tour in 2007, he did all that kind of grunt work and more and then – as we all know – he did quite well on GC on his account. Not to mention complete the 2013 Tour with a busted pelvis. So Thomas might get my vote as 'best rider' for all the obvious reasons like winning the Tour (and not getting stuck up about it, either, which doesn't always happen), but even more so for what he was and did for his team for years beforehand.

Realistically, this should just say Tadej Pogačar, but the Tour de France is about more than just winning the yellow jersey. Attacking, courage, occasional recklessness, and daredevil descending all make up part of racing with the romantic attribute of panache, something that has played a crucial part in making the Tour and its protagonists great for 122 years. No one, I think, has embodied or personified panache better thanJulian Alaphilippesince 2010, so he gets my vote.
A true showman, Alaphilippe has been applying his swashbuckling trade to home roads at the Tour since 2016. A wearer of all four Tour jerseys, and six times a stage winner, often from opportunistic moves or punchy brilliance, Alaphilippe always had you on the edge of your seat when the goatee, rainbow jersey or flamboyant style on the bike appeared at the front of the action.
On that initial point of yellow, too, his quite unbelievable run in the lead of the 2019 Tour, when he gave the French hope for their first home maillot jaune triumph in 34 years, was perhaps the most enthralling that racing got in the 2010s. He ultimately came up short, but not winning too much, and his propensity to attack instead of save energy for a GC run never wavered, only adding to the panache, and his allure as an iconic Tour de France racer.

Watching the Tour de France on a live US broadcast each year has been a ritual for my family, what we considered to be a travel documentary wrapped around 21 consecutive days of reality sports competition. No one made it more fun to watch in the last 15 years than Thomas Voeckler.
The Frenchman's relentless attacking style, first shown in the 2004 Tour when he earned the maillot jaune from a fearless attack with four others, was elevated by his demonstrative physical display of anguish – his face contorted with a mix of pain and passion that begged for us to scream at the TV either 'allez, allez' or 'what are you doing?'
By 2010, he earned a second stage win at his home Grand Tour, and the next year reclaimed the yellow jersey for a chunk of the race when, from a breakaway, he finished on the podium on stage 9. Not known as a true climber, he even earned the polka-dot KOM jersey for one day at the Tour in 2012, suffering with a knee injury but surviving from a breakaway, with all of us cheering at home, to win atop Col du Grand Colombier.
We were never certain if the strain on Voeckler's face was theatre or pure effort, but he became both a French legend and the face of a breakaway on a world stage.

I so want to say Cadel Evans, perhaps not a surprising reaction from an Australian, because his win in 2011 was the one that looms the largest for me. There is no underestimating the spotlight and legacy that win delivered in a nation where in normal circumstances, cycling barely graces the sports pages – an Australian wearing yellow in Paris, however, was far from normal circumstances.
Though the ride Evans delivered that year may be the most unforgettable for me, once the initial emotional response passes, I can’t help but pause and examine the question through a different lens. Ever-tainted by my former existence as a finance journalist, I felt compelled to ditch the personal parochial perspective and follow the drag of statistics. Look at the last five years and Tadej Pogačar, already the winner of three editions in the 20s, and with plenty of promise that the run will continue could be considered an obvious choice. Still, as the saying goes, ‘don’t count your chickens before they hatch,’ plus we aren’t just talking about the here and now, but also the decade before Pogačar emerged as a Tour de France force.
So, perhaps the rider who has ended up in yellow in Paris more than any other over the last 15 years deserves the title of best rider. It doesn’t matter if in recent years that rider has had to battle to find a place on the start line, let alone near the top of the results table – that doesn’t change what he did in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017.Chris Froome, with his four wins, has a Tour de France record that, based on number of overall victories, delivers a clear and deserved claim on the title of best rider of the last 15 years – I’d say inarguable, in fact, but we all know that’s never really the case…

Mark Cavendish ended his career with a record 35 stage wins, just asBiniam Girmaywrote his name into cycling's history books as the first Black African to win a stage at the Tour de France, winning three stages and the coveted green points jersey in 2024.
He also made his hometown fans even prouder by securing Eritrea's first-ever Tour de France stage win in the process.
Launched into cycling's stardom, Girmay has followed in the footsteps of compatriots Natnael Berhane, Merhawi Kudus, and Daniel Teklehaimanot, who became the first Black African to start the Tour de France in 2015, offering him a glimpse of what he could aspire to become.
Everyone loves a trailblazer, and I'm no exception. Girmay's history-making achievements have sparked celebration, emotion, inspiration and will undoubtedly open the door for more African riders to follow in his success.
Girmay has made a tremendous impact at the tail end of the last 15 years of the Tour de France. However, in a relatively short period, his achievements have been groundbreaking and have resonated far beyond the sport. This sprinter represents the future the world wants to see in professional cycling in the years to come.

Ever since I first stumbled onto a live broadcast of the Tour de France at the age of 12, I have been rooting for the breakaway.
The breakaway is cycling's eternal underdog, forever in the shadow of the 180-strong peloton beating down on the stage victory ambitions of a select few doomed escapees.
In the recent history of the Tour de France, no rider has embodied the ill-fated bravery of the breakaway likeThomas De Gendt. In his nine editions of the race, he attacked in the mountains, on the dead flat, from the gun and beneath the Flamme Rouge - more often than not in the face of certain defeat.
In 2017, De Gendt spent a startling 1,280km of the Tour de France out front in a breakaway. It's a preoccupation the Belgian is clearly proud of, too, as a social media post after that Tour showed he kept a meticulous diary of his kilometres spent in an escape.
Twice, his efforts bore fruit: first in 2016, with an iconic victory atop Mount Ventoux (somewhat overshadowed by Chris Froome's now-infamous jog) and again in 2019 on stage 8 – cheered on by millions of breakaway believers.
De Gendt's attacks have always represented more than stage ambitions. These were acts of defiance against the authority of the peloton's natural order. In the age of ever-more control in a more competitive landscape of our sport, it's a riding style we may not see again.

'El Pistolero' might not be everyone's favourite Tour de France rider but there is no mistaking the aggression, excitement and controversy that Alberto Contador brought to the table during his 10 appearances in the race.
His first Tour victory came in 2007 when race leader Michael Rasmussen was pulled from the race over skipped doping controls. Thrust into the maillot jaune after stage 16, Contador won by a slim 23 seconds over Cadel Evans.
In 2009, Contador had to fight teammate Lance Armstrong for team leadership, but won the Tour in a commanding fashion despite being bullied by Armstrong loyalists in the team.
In 2010, Contador ignited a heated debate on cycling's unwritten rules when he attacked as rival Andy Schleck dropped his chain. The Spaniard won the race by 39 seconds only to have his victory overturned after he tested positive for minute quantities of clenbuterol.
Although drama and doping scandals hounded Contador throughout his career, his eight Grand Tour and two Tour victories make him one of the greatest stage racers of the age.

Romain Bardet's best result at the Tour de France was second behind Chris Froome in 2016 but his 14-year career, his frequent Tour heartbreak and his decision not to ride this year's Tour as his 'last dance' epitomises his and France's love-hate relationship with the race.
The Tour made Bardet famous and respected as a rider but also hurt him physically and mentally each July, as the pressure mounted on his skinny shoulders to step-up and end France's 40-year spell without a win. Sadly there was never a fairytale ending but Bardet is intelligent enough to accept the cruelty of professional cycling.
At his swash blucking best Bardet could win mountain stages, usually from a breakaway and his last win and the yellow jersey in Rimini in 2024 arguably made up for all his previous Tour disappointment and pain.
Bardet retired after the Critérium du Dauphiné, not as a snub to the Tour but out of respect to the effort needed to compete with the best rather than consider it a three-week farewell ride.
Bardet will be at the 2025 Tour de France, reporting from a motorbike for Eurosport and TNT for a week. Some are even tipping him as future race director when Christian Prudhomme retires. He can't escape the emotions of the Tour, it will always be part of his life.

I'll take the obvious one then, shall I? In every sense of the word, Tadej Pogačar is the best Tour rider in the modern era. He's immensely talented, driven, likeable, engaging for sponsors, and inspiring for young riders across the world.
He has ridden five Tours de France, won three of them, and has never finished lower than 2nd on GC. After five Tours and 105 stages, he's spent just two nights outside the top 10 – both of which came on his debut in 2020, a race he went on to win.
In that winning debut, he joined an elite list of all-time greats to have achieved the feat, including Anquetil, Merckx, Fignon and Hinault. He's also the youngest rider to win the race in the modern era; a feat he achieved a day shy of his 22nd birthday.
Since then, he's gone on to clock 17 stages. His closest Tour de France rival, Jonas Vingegaard, has just four stages in an equal number of starts. Cavendish's total of 35 stages is impressive, but Pogačar is almost halfway there after five editions. Cavendish rode fifteen.
And he wins everywhere. He challenges the likes of Filippo Ganna in time trials on Monday and then goes and destroys the pure climbers in the mountains on Tuesday. Come spring, he goes head-to-head with Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert in one-day races too.
His pure talent is undeniable, but he's also an exciting racer, not robotic like Froome at his peak or like Vingegaard is often perceived today. I'm sure, behind the scenes, he's just as meticulous and process-driven but come race day he doesn't ignore his racing instinct. He attacks when it feels right, and he sometimes makes mistakes, but he'll still talk to the press when he's beaten with a smile on his face and an 'it's just a bike race' nonchalance.
He somehow does it all with a modesty and humility that befalls most successful athletes, too. He jokes with his competitors on social media, replies to DMs from fans, engages with his sponsors at events, has time for young fans at race starts and, more than anything, he simply enjoys racing."
'They should try for it' – Eddy Merckx argues for Tadej Pogačar and Remco Evenepoel to both attempt the Hour Record,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/they-should-try-for-it-eddy-merckx-argues-for-tadej-pogacar-and-remco-evenepoel-to-both-attempt-the-hour-record/,0.9839,"More than half a century after he took the Hour Record, Eddy Merckx has flung down the gauntlet on behalf of two of cycling's top stars, and suggested bothTadej Pogačar(UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Remco Evenepoel(Soudal-QuickStep)try for one of the sport's most venerated challenges.
Merckx made the suggestion in Belgian newspaperLe Soir,during one of multiple media interviews to commemorate his 80th birthday this June.
Currently held by Filippo Ganna(Ineos Grenadiers) with a distance of 56.792 kilometres, back in October 1972 Merckx set the Hour Record at 49.431 kilometres.
Both before and after Merckx, other top Tour de France winners and GC contenders have tried for the Hour Record, most recently 2012 Tour champion Bradley Wiggins, but before the Briton, Merckx, Miguel Indurain, and Jacques Anquetil, amongst others.
""My career would not be complete without the Record,"" Merckx toldLe Soir. ""At the end of 1972, I felt tired, I wasn't in form, but after three weeks of specific preparation in Italy, I was recovered.
""We crossed the Atlantic to Mexico and it all worked out well. But I suffered a lot. After that effort, I could barely walk for a week.""
As for whether Evenepoel or Pogačar could be better at the Hour Record, Merckx said he was not sure.

""The Slovenian is the best, the most versatile rider out there. But Remco has incredible aerodynamics. It would be wonderful if they tried this challenge.""
While Evenepoel has not discussed doing the Hour Record, in the case of Pogačar, at least, Merckx's idea looks very unlikely to happen.
WhenCyclingnewsspecifically asked UAE Team Emirates sports manager Joxean Fernández Matxin back in January about Pogačar going for the Hour Record one day, Matxin dismissed the idea that there could be any interest in such a project. He said that they had never discussed Pogačar taking part in any kind of track event, let alone such a major challenge.
""With Pogačar, it's a very different kind of cycling,"" Matxin toldCyclingnews.""To tell you the truth, ever since I first met him in 2017, we've never once talked about track racing at all. Never. It's never come into our conversation, neither on his part, or mine, or the team's.""
Merckx, in any case, insisted inLe Soirthat when it came to the Tour de France, Pogačar remained ""The man to beat. What I saw him do this spring was impressive. I hope that [Jonas] Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) is going better than at the start of the year, he wasn't doing great before he fell in Paris-Nice.
""Remco hasn't raced so much since his accident in December, he can have a lot of energy stored up. But in the high mountains, following the World Champion [Pogačar] won't be easy."""
"'It's only won on July 27, not before' - The gameplan behind UAE Team Emirates-XRG's bid to win Tour de France number 4 with Tadej Pogačar",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/its-a-question-of-realism-why-uae-team-emirates-xrg-are-anything-but-complacent-about-tadej-pogacars-chances-of-tour-de-france-victory-number-four/,0.9998,"""Pogacar isn't a gamble, he's a sure-fire value. He's a champion,"" was how Joxean Fernández Matxin once assertively described the current world's number one cyclist and leadingTour de Francefavourite,Tadej Pogačar, in an interview way back in 2019.
That particular claim by theUAE Team Emirates-XRGhead of sport about the squad's leader was made well before the Slovenian had fully (and amply) proven his worth in three-week stage racing and when his dreams of capturing multiple Monuments or the rainbow jersey were still only just that – dreams.
But a lot of water has since gone under the bridge, and we've now reached the point where Pogačar's status as top favourite for a fourth Tour de France this year is such that it almost feels like all the UAE Team Emirates leader has to do is turn up in Lille on July 5 and he'll have won it already. These days the man, as Matxin put it so presciently six years ago, is anything but a gamble.
EvenJonas Vingegaard(Visma-Lease a Bike), Pogačar's arch-rival for Tour glory since 2021 (and whose last Tour victory, it's worth remembering amidst all the Pogi-worship, was only two years ago) has tipped Pogačar as the rider most likely to be in yellow on July 27 in Paris. Yet amidst all that near-general consensus, it's striking how Matxin, the man at the heart of the UAE engine room behind Pogačar since 2019, may not talk about gambles any more, but he continues to insist that things aren't nearly as safe a bet as a quick glance at the results sheets, from the 2025 Dauphiné all the way back to last year's Tour and beyond, would suggest.
""It's not a question of being cautious, it's a question of realism,"" Matxin tellsCyclingnewstwo weeks out from the Tour. ""You have to be realistic.""
""Everything you've done up to now is good for measuring your own strength and measuring yourself against your rivals. But at the end of the day, we all know that the Tour is the Tour.
""The race starts on July 5, not at the beginning of June, and it's only won on July 27, not before. You could say that's that's even more the case this time round, when on the very last day of the Tour, there's a stage that's anything but straightforward.""
After more than 30 years in the business, then, Matxin seemingly remains very aware that things can change at the drop of a hat in cycling, and even more so when the tide seems set remorselessly in one rider's favour – as it does now with Tadej Pogačar. The history books confirm that too: you certainly don't have to go so far back asMiguel Indurainin 1996, say, who had five straight Tour de France wins to his name when he won the Dauphiné hands-down that June, but who then collapsed spectacularly in the Tour, finishing eleventh.
Or as Matxin puts it: ""When you get ahead like Tadej, you try to stay ahead. But when you have a top-level objective, be it individual or collective, you quickly realise the hardest thing isn't to win. The hardest thing is staying up there.""
Maintaining enough of a winning margin to be sure of staying ahead in the game, in other words, is what Matxin sees as the biggest challenge. And for some fans, given the way that the Vingegaard-Pogačar rivalry has now endured for such an unprecedentedly long period of time that simply means beating the Dane.
That point of view is helped by the fact that historically no other two riders have ever occupied the top two spots of the Tour's final podium for so many consecutive editions, albeit swapping around first and second. But according to that mathematical logic, if nothing else, means that if Pogačar loses, then Vingegaard automatically wins, and vice versa.

After five tours, Vingegaard and Pogačar can still not be definitively separated
Yet more 'evidence' for that perhaps reductionist take is that globally and time-wise – save for last year's knock-out edition in favour of Pogačar – the rivalry between Pogačar and Vingegaard has been too close to call. In the four editions since the start of the 2021 race and their first 1-2 result in Paris, if you remove the bonus seconds, and add up the total time used by each, overall it comes out in favour of Vingegaard by three seconds.
However, Matxin not only rejects that particular piece of data as irrelevant. He also opens up the rivalry faced by Pogačar to far more names than just Vingegaard. A certain Belgian world time trial champion who finished third in the Tour last year is at the top of the list, but it goes way beyond that.
""The time they each took is not important, because what matters is if you've won the Tour or if you've lost it. And right now, it's 3-2 in favour of Tadej,"" he said.
""But in any case, if you take the case of a rider like [Isaac] Del Toro in the Giro d'Italia. In terms of Grand Tours, he came out of nowhere, and look how close he got to winning the Giro. So you have to remember how many other, new riders could suddenly be in the mix as well. There'sRemco [Evenepoel]but he's not the only rider on the rise. But why can't others be too?
""Like I said, you have to be realistic. You have realise that just as Tadej or Vingegaard suddenly came on the scene in the way Tadej did back in the day"" - a reference to Pogačar's last-minute surprise victory againstPrimož Rogličin 2020 - ""so can somebody else. You just can't sleep on your laurels.""
Yet for all Matxin's words of warning about how the race could be impacted dramatically by new names, not just the familiar ones, he obviously doesn't ignore the fact that Vingegaard and Pogačar have been sharing the top of the classification for the last four years, either. Interestingly, too, for all that neither has proved able to get the better of the other in a definitive manner, Matxin believes that 2025 will mark a new phase, given the events of 2023 and 2024.
""The last two Tours have been impacted by the falls the two of them had before the race,"" he points out – Pogačar in 2023, breaking his wrist in Liège-Bastogne-Liège, and Vingegaard in 2024 inItzulia Basque Country, suffering multiple, more serious fractures.
""So now they're facing up to each other again, and that's maybe the most important element of the race. Neither of them has had any setbacks like that this year, so it's a straight duel this time round.""
The absence of 'what-ifs' or 'yes, buts' to cloud the argument will not only make for a more level playing field. It also ensures that the gloves will be off from the word go, Matxin points out. Neither rider, knowing their rival is in top condition, will want to give them the least opportunity to gain the slightest advantage.
""And goodness knows there are enough nervous first-week stages for them to do battle in;"" he adds, before ticking them off. ""Stage 2 to Boulogne: very nervous; the one to Dunkerque [stage 3]: I don't even want to think about; the one to Rouen: nervous; the one to Normandie [stage 6]: also nervous; the stage to the Mur de Bretagne [stage 7]: also nervous... If you take away the first time trial, there are nine stages where the tension is going to be perpetually at boiling point.""
Rather than the usual armed truce in the opening phases of the Tour, then, this extended battle has already stretched back into the Dauphiné and erupted between the team domestiques, let alone the main actors. As Fred Wright (Bahrain Victorious) pointed out, there were points in the Dauphiné's first transition stages – and this even in the flatter moments or downhills where there was no conceivable advantage to them doing so – where UAE and Visma were already fighting each other to be in control. The underlying reason being: the stakes have got so high now, any excuse for a battle is a good one.

Tadej Pogačar is not one to pass up an opportunity to iwn
To go back to Indurain, though, the five-times Tour winner always used to say that rather than rivals, the one person he was truly scared of was himself: would he be up to scratch, able to meet all the challenges? Viewed in that optic, Pogačar's most immediate challenges could be seen as time trialling – the one point in which not only Vingegaard, but also Remco Evenepoel and even Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) outpowered him in the Dauphiné – and whether, given Vingegaard's emphasis on endurance as his strong point, he'll still be on top of the game come the third week.
Regarding the time trialling, the way the Slovenian looked over Vingegaard's bike at the finish of theDauphiné's TT stage, after losing nearly 30 seconds in 17.4 kilometres to the Dane, said far more than anything he could have told the media about his defeat – which in any case, he didn't, refusing to comment to the press at all. Rather like the Le Lioran stage of the Tour last year, where it briefly looked as if Vingegaard had finally drawn equal with Pogačar, for a while the Dauphiné TT felt like it could have been a turning point, a moment when the balance tipped back in favour of the Dane.
As we all now know, that proved to be a pipe-dream, both in the Tour last year and again in the Dauphiné this June. In both cases, Pogačar was subsequently able to inflict stinging defeats on his arch-rival in the mountains. But the time trial nonetheless remains a question mark about Pogačar's performance that UAE need to answer, particularly as if the times are extrapolated from 17 kilometres in the Dauphiné TT to the 33 on the equivalent stage 5 of the Tour, Pogačar could find himself lagging behind Vingegaard and Evenepoel and forced to attack in the mountains.
""The Dauphine TT was probably something to do with how he gauged his efforts, I'm pretty clear about that,"" Matxin said by way of explanation. ""Plus it all happened when he wasn't having a superlative day, either.
""Tadej isn't always superlative and unfortunately, it seems like when he doesn't have that kind of excellence, for a lot of people, suddenly it's like he had a really bad day. But at the same time, you can't underestimate the rivals, either: they know how to race well and that's what they did on that particular stage.""
There are other points in the 2025 Tour route where the Vingegaard-Pogačar rivalry will be raking over even older coals in their rivalry. There's the Hautacam on stage 11, for example, where Vingegaard placed the definitive nail in the Slovenian's GC coffin in the 2022 Tour, and the Ventoux, where Vingegaard briefly dropped Pogačar in the 2021 edition, but could not dislodge him from the top spot overall. The most emotionally charged trip down memory lane, though, will surely be the Col de la Loze, where in 2023 Pogačar's radio message, ""I'm dead, I'm gone"", made it clear that the Dane had swept away all obstacles to a second straight overall win and Pogačar was doomed to a second place overall.
So will Pogačar be inspired or daunted by those memories? Neither, says Matxin.
""We can't live off the past, to be frank, neither for better or for worse. So I don't think what happened two or three years ago has anything to do with what could happen now. They're just circumstantial, particularly when the race does things like, for example, going over the Col du Glandon this time round before it goes up the Loze.""
""It's not a question of what you've got to face and what happened there in the past. It's a question of whether you've got the physical capacity to handle it now.""
Come what may in the Tour, what hasn't changed is Pogačar's delight in racing. As Matxin confirms, for whether the Slovenian is on victory number 99 or 199, his innate desire to go on punishing his rivals shows no sign of abating at all.
""It's part of his winning DNA,"" Matxin argues. ""He's got a very strong personality and he's not a champion, he's a leader.""
""Because if a champion wins, he does it for himself, whereas when a leader wins, he's concerned about his teammates. And that's Tadej, he's always worried about the whole team, no matter the result.""
""That attitude pays dividends as well. When riders of the class of [João] Almeida, Tim Wellens, Pavel Sivakov and Jhonatan Narvaéz are willing to bury themselves for him, riders who are at WorldClass level, it's because he's capable of recognising their hard work.""
""Then if you look at the results he's taken in the Tour – first, first, second, second, first – there's evidently a reason to fight for a rider like that, a reason why he keeps people onside, because you know what he can give you.
""That level of consistent success, or near-success, really inspires everybody: the staff, the riders, and the whole team. And Tadej appreciates that.""

Pogačar put on a show of dominance over Vingegaard at the Dauphiné
Sharing the mutual benefits of success, but not taking anything for granted does sound like a surefire way of keeping the troops on board and keen to fight. But as Matxin says, another huge point of motivation for Pogačar, of course, is that he is defending a title in 2025.
""Fighting with number one on your back always does give you an extra level of inspiration, no matter the race. It's the same as when you lose, you try to feed off that sense of anger or unfinished business and defeat to try to push back.
""This time, it's the opposite way round for Tadej, he's got that motivation as defending champion – but you have to look for the positive side of things, either way.
""So that's his extra reason to be motivated to try and do things as well as possible. But you have to remember too, that you don't always win.""
It's true that in the 2025 Tour Pogačar will be facing rivals as formidable as Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel and whoever else is in the mix. And quite apart from the young, unpredictable Del Toro-esque elements we don't know about, is it really that wise to rule out a five-time Grand Tour winner like Primož Roglič from the running, for example?
Yet at the same time, such is the scale of Pogačar's success across, with those 99 wins and counting in all manner of races from Monuments to Grand Tours, that parts of his fight are now completely invisible. Day by day, race by race, Pogačar is crossing swords, albeit silently and unintentionally, with the biggest ever names in the sport itself.
Just in terms of the Tour, Pogačar's aim of victory would, if achieved, see him leave behind three-time winners Louison Bobet, Greg LeMond and Philippe Thys, and joinChris Froomeas one of just five riders with four Tour victories or more in their palmares. Furthermore, when Pogačar won his third Tour de France last July at 26, at the same age Froome – the most recent rider to take four – was still two years off getting his first. As for Indurain, the most recent to take five Tours, he did not win a single edition until he was 27.
So UAE's main message prior to this year's Tour is to warn against any creeping complacency, and the scale of the opposition and the Tour route itself certainly provide ample reasons for them and their star rider to remain as razor-sharp focused as ever.
But for all Matxin's realism – or caution – it's also true that Pogačar is starting both the immediate, short-term Tour de France battle in pole position. It's also true that in the cycling history game, regardless of what happens this summer, Pogačar is already miles ahead of his rivals. And no matter what happens between Lille and Paris this summer, that's one race he won't be losing soon.

"Pole vault and Tadej Pogačar – Why the World Champion's dominance at Critérium du Dauphiné or the Tour de France is a privilege to watch, not boring",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/pole-vault-and-tadej-pogacar-why-the-world-champions-dominance-at-criterium-du-dauphine-or-the-tour-de-france-is-a-privilege-to-watch-not-boring/,0.9997,"It's Sunday evening, and what am I doing? Watching pole vault. A seriously specific event, yes, and one that could often be avoided as a spectacle, especially for a routine meeting of the Diamond League, but with Mondo Duplantis in action, it offers a rare opportunity to watch the best athlete ever in their sport compete today.
Yes, I know he is going to win. I also know he is probably going to break the world record again. I'll save you the wait – he did, for a 12th time – but yet, mine and everyone in the Stockholm Olympic Stadium's eyes were glued on him successfully clearing 6.28m, 38cm higher than second-place.
Is the lack of competition boring to me? Of course not… he's so dominant that I've started watching pole vault of all things. Granted, the 1cm incremental jumps are for a financial incentive each time he breaks his own world record, but being the entertainer he is, I can't help but keep coming back.
Now it's obviously hard to compare such a specific track and field event to the drawn-out, nuanced battles of professional road cycling, but I at least have a similar feeling watchingTadej Pogačarthat I do to Duplantis - that I'm watching the best ever. It's perhaps fitting that the latter beat the former, and several other sporting superstars, to the Laureus Sportsman of the Year award for 2024, even despite Pogačar's historic Triple Crown triumph of the Giro d'Italia,Tour de Franceand World Championships.
Now, was I as certain that Pogačar was going to win the Critérium du Dauphiné as Duplantis on Sunday? No, especially after thestage 4 time trial, where he suffered big losses to both Remco Evenepoel and Jonas Vingegaard. That changed after stage 6, of course, when he dominated the route to Combloux and put a minute into main Tour de France rival Vingegaard on such a short climbing effort, ending the GC race with an anti-climactic seated surge.
I'm not bored, though, as many seem to be after watching the World Champion ride solo to the finish again and again, despite the final weekend of mountain stages seeing Pogačar seemingly ease to overall victory at the Dauphiné.
While at the same time, I'm not going to push that ""you're watching greatness, just enjoy it"" sentiment onto you, I can't help but feel that excellence, and with it dominance, is the ""raison d'être of elite sport"", as I read it described when looking intodiscourse around trainer Willie Mullins' domination of horse racing.

If not for the superstars, then underdog wins wouldn't mean as much. Pogačar rarely loses, and that can make racing predictable, but he isthepinnacle. So, when he does come unstuck, it makes it all the more exciting.
I've only been a cycling journalist in the Pogačar era, and my two favourite days working on races, not reporting on the ground, have beenstage 11 of the Tour de France in 2024andAmstel Gold Racethis season. Both saw the seemingly infallible Pogačar blast away in one of his typical solo moves that usually end a race at his discretion, but both saw him get chased down and outsprinted to the victory.
It was Vingegaard who managed it at the Tour, with fueling mistakes from Pogačar seeing the Dane take an emotional win, and Mattias Skjelmose in the Dutch Classic, thanks to monster work from Evenepoel to chase down the rainbow jersey.
For me, Pogačar's failure to convert brought feelings akin to that of watching an undefeated boxer losing their '0' in shock fashion. Think back to Mike Tyson falling to Buster Douglas in 1990, or Anthony Joshua tasting his first defeat at the hands of replacement and huge underdog Andy Ruiz in 2019, for a more recent, less significant example.
Pogačar's air of invincibility is just as important to his legacy as his humble personality, as the key to unlocking shocking defeats when they do emerge. Even the time trial was a big surprise, obviously not that he didn't beat the Olympic and World champion in the discipline, Evenepoel, but that his margin of defeat was so big over only 17km – 48 seconds.

Even when he's at his dominant best, though, it feels like more of a privilege to me, to be working and writing about the best rider since Eddy Merckx, with no real feeling of what it must have been like watching the Cannibal feast on any and every race back in the late 60s and 70s.
I don't find it boring seeing him off the front for as long as he is. That may come from my general view of sport being about seeing the best, but from him dropping back to fetch his only support rider Pavel Sivakov a bottle before the final climb on stage 7 of the Dauphiné, or him allowing Vingegaard to come past him for second on stage 8, Pogačar in total, supreme control of a race is unmissable.
He's able to do whatever he wants, at will. For someone who grew up with Messi and Ronaldo in football, Bolt in athletics and Federer, Nadal and Djokovic in tennis, that absolute peak of dominance is part of what draws me into the sports themselves.
That control, to me, took the form of subtle mind games for Pogačar, with the Tour approaching quickly. Him dropping back for that bottle is the type of flex that reminded me of the Plateau de Beille stage of last year's Tour, when he took his hands off the bars and emptied a bidon over his head 10km from the finish, before responding to all of Vingegaard's attacks and dropping him to win solo in one of his best-ever performances..
After the TT, he laid down a statement with the win on stage 6, but that was enough bravado for one week, with his stage 7 victory being much more low-key, and the final day looking like a Sunday training ride. It's not often a rider can choose when his 100th pro win arrives, just ask Alexander Kristoff, but Pogačar looks set to have that milestone arrive at the Tour after allowing Lenny Martínez and the break to succeed on Sunday as he moved to 99, not out.

The question of Pogačar making cycling 'boring' with his dominance is one that has followed him ever since it became clear he was the best we'd seen since Bernard Hinault and Merckx of yesteryear, producing the all-round calendar supremacy that was a dying art in the 2010s. And it will follow him until a successor emerges, or he retires.
But it's a unique time for the sport in this golden era of superstars led by Pogačar. With Mathieu van der Poel also present, the balance of powers in the Classics is maintained – all of San Remo, Flanders and Roubaix in 2025 more than proved that. But without Vingegaard, too, his legacy is nowhere near as enthralling. Let's not forget that the 2024 Tour was a bounce-back win for the Slovenian, who in 2022 and 2023 was well beaten by the Dane at the Tour.
Now, with Pogačar addressing his limited weaknesses of old – which could have been seen as struggles at high altitude or in the heat – shown in his destruction of the Pyrenees last year, and big crashes and time out with injury for Vingegaard in the past two seasons, the balanace has swung back massively in Pogačar's favour. And the Dauphiné suggests it is going to stay that way.
Even his newer seated style of attacking is one sign of constant evolution from Pogačar, looking always to move clear of his rival.
So this begs the question, how did Vingegaard ever beat Pogačar when the gap between the two appears now insurmountable?

Looking back, it was of course Visma-Lease a Bike's team masterclass on the road to the Col du Granon that dealt the main blow in 2022, with Vingegaard following that on the Hautacam to complete the job.
The year after, while Pogačar famously stating ""I'm gone, I'm dead"" on the lower slopes of the Col de la Loze is remembered more as the moment that Tour ended, it was on the time trial one day earlier that Vingegaard surely broke the Slovenian's resolve, smashing him en route to Combloux by 1:38.
I was there as a fan that day, on the Côte de Domancy, and it's the most vulnerable I've ever seen Pogačar, who changed bikes just a few metres away from me, while Vingegaard contrastingly, flew by at breakneck speeds on that blazing hot day. Seeing that defeated champion once again dominating is quite remarkable now, given how we're still not two years on.
If one all-time great comes along then you can count yourself lucky, but having Vingegaard as the foil to Pogačar makes this job all the more enjoyable. Just look at tennis now, with Djokovic's imminent retirement, there could have been fears of a star quality vacuum, but with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner emerging, that sport couldn't be in better hands.
Sport needs rivalries, and storylines, but it needs dominance too. Someone rising above the rest should always be championed, as those in pursuit work to try and close that gap. Vingegaard and Visma are amid that chase now, with three weeks to the Tour's start, and a lot of distance to make up.

There are complacent voices who believe the Tour will be three weeks of boring non-competition, but why should Vingegaard's performance only point negatively towards a close-fought Tour? The gap, albeit Pogačar could've extended it, but still, was only 59 seconds, and it was Vingegaard's first race since he got concussed in March, whereas his rival has had a clean run in 2025.
Also, yes, Pogačar was superior at the Dauphiné, but the Dane has only beaten Pogačar in a one-week stage race once, with the pair finishing second and third respectively behind Primož Roglič at Itzulia Basque Country in 2021. Vingegaard came good in '22 and '23 after losing to Pogačar in Tirreno-Adriatico and Paris-Nice of those seasons – March is different to June, but the point remains.
The three-week tests, with longer stages and a greater accumulation of fatigue, are where Vingegaard and his team have found the way to defeat Pogačar, so what's to say they won't again? Team strength at the Dauphiné was a mixed bag for both, with Narváez's lead-out on stage 6 showing the best of UAE Team Emirates, but Sivakov being his only domestique one day later proved how he can get isolated.
Of course, neither had full-strength Tour teams on show, with Adam Yates and João Almeida still to enter Pogačar's arsenal, and Wout van Aert and Simon Yates ready to support Vingegaard after a successful Giro. But, even then, fortune at the Tour can run out very quickly and change the whole shape of a Grand Tour, with the crashes and chaos of the first week to avoid.
Dominance or not, Pogačar's presence makes cycling infinitely better. Even though he himself may be starting to feel the inequality of results take its toll, joking after a shock win on stage 1 of the Dauphiné, where the superstars came to the fore, ""Don't worry, everybody, maybe I'll retire soon when my contract is finished"".
That would be in 2030, and see him just into his 30s. I, for one, certainly want his time in the sport to go on longer, knowing full well he is the best I'll probably ever see. Hopefully, those who complain of his dominance now can appreciate it before he is gone, because the likes of what he's able to do is something we haven't seen for nigh-on 50 years.
Be it Pogačar or pole vault, sporting supremacy may not be your cup of tea, but seeing the absolute best of the best will always be what keeps me coming back. Bring on July 5, and bring on the Tour de France.

Green jersey champion Biniam Girmay and young Intermarché-Wanty squad 'squarely focused on stage victories' at Tour de France,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/green-jersey-champion-biniam-girmay-and-young-intermarche-wanty-squad-squarely-focused-on-stage-victories-at-tour-de-france/,0.9964,"Intermarché-Wanty have become the third team to unveil their lineup for theTour de France, with the Belgian team throwing their weight behindBiniam Girmayas they seek to stave off the threat of WorldTour relegation.
Girmay heads into the Tour as the reigning points classification winner, having taken three stage victories on the way to taking home the green jersey last summer.
The Eritrean, who became the first Black African to win a Tour stage in Turin last July, has yet to win a race in 2025. However, he represents the team's best chance of success at the Tour and will once again be in the mix for green.
French racerLouis Barré, the team's second-best performer this season, is a rider to watch in a young Intermarché-Wanty squad largely geared around supporting Girmay.
The 25-year-old from Nantes is making his Tour de France debut and has 15 top-10 results to his name in 2025, Trofeo Laigueglia, Paris-Camembert, Amstel Gold Race, the Giro dell'Appennino, and two stages of the Dauphiné.
24-year-olds Vito Braet and Roel van Sintmaartensdijk are also making their Tour debuts, while 23-year-old Hugo Page and 25-year-oldLaurenz Rexare taking on the race for a second year in a row.
Page, the second Frenchman in the selection, has top 10s at the Famenne Ardenne Classic and Copenhagen Sprint to his name this season, while Belgian racer Rex performed strongly throughout the spring, having scored top-10 finishes at Classic Brugge-De Panne, Gent-Wevelgem, Paris-Roubaix, and the Antwerp Port Epic.

A pair of 27-year-olds, Jonas Rutsch, who finished sixth at Roubaix, andGeorg Zimmermann, who won the Giro d'Abruzzo, round out the eight-man team as the veterans of the group. Rutsch, who moved from EF Education-EasyPost over the winter, has two Tours to his name, while Zimmermann will race his fifth Tour.
""To build on our success from the 2024 Tour de France, we started working back in August to assemble a team squarely focused on stage victories for the 2025 edition,"" saidIntermarché-Wantyperformance manager Aike Visbeek.
""Biniam Girmay is naturally our spearhead for sprint finishes and stages with tricky finals. We've strengthened the core around him by integrating Jonas Rutsch into our team, alongside Laurenz Rex and Hugo Page, and by regularly having talents like Vito Braet and Roel van Sintmaartensdijk race with Biniam.
""Roel's selection marks an important moment for our structure. In 2023, he was the first young talent to raise his arms with our U23 Continental Team. Now, he's the first from our development structure to make his debut in the Tour de France, which speaks volumes about the progress made and the hard work of our staff.
""Vito is a quiet but powerful force, capable of performing well in the sprint stage with tough profiles. Both are invaluable assets for Biniam's lead-out train. Jonas highlighted his potential at Paris-Roubaix; he's one of our options for stage hunting through aggressive racing.
""We also have two other serious contenders for stage wins with Georg Zimmermann, who's riding his fifth Tour with us, and Louis Barré, the revelation of the first season half. Both are ready to animate the stages. Louis is making his Tour debut, and we're eager to see what he can achieve, especially after what he recently demonstrated at the Dauphiné.""
As well as the primary goal of seeking stage victories and keeping Girmay in the points classification battle, Intermarché-Wanty will head to France hoping to pick up UCI points as they battle against potential relegation from cycling's top flight for 2026.
The team has won just twice in 2025 and currentlylanguishes in 16th place in the UCI rankings, with their three-year haul of 24,387 points putting them just 1,176 clear of the 19th-placed team, Cofidis.
Girmay (775 points), Barré (573), and Rex (487) are responsible for almost half of the team's 3,980-point haul this season, and the team will be looking to both to add more to their tally this July.
Last year's Tour saw Girmay rack up 3,352 points on his own; even a partial repeat performance from the team's star rider would see the Belgian squad safe in the WorldTour for another three seasons.

Final season of Netflix's Tour de France: Unchained to release just three days before 2025 Grand Départ in Lille,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/final-season-of-netflixs-tour-de-france-unchained-to-release-just-three-days-before-2025-grand-depart-in-lille/,0.9557,"Netflix has unveiled the trailer and release date for the third and final season of theTour de France: Unchained documentary, which gives a detailed insight into the behind-the-scenes action of the 2024 race.
It's set to release on the streaming service on July 2, just three days before the Grand Départ of this year's Tour de France in Lille on July 5. In 2024, the series was released 18 days before the race's start, while the year prior, fans had 22 days to digest the episodes before the first stage.
The trailer, released by Netflix France on Wednesday morning, shows a heavy focus on eventual race winnerTadej Pogačarand his UAE Team Emirates-XRG squad, with several frames filmed in the UAE.
Mark Cavendish's record 35th stage winwill also be one of the key storylines, likely alongside Biniam Girmay taking three historic victories,Remco Evenepoeland Jonas Vingegaard challenging the Slovenian, and the crashes and chaos of the race, which have featured heavily in the first two seasons.
It wasconfirmed in February that this would be the final seasonafter just three series, with a statement being issued to several media outlets to explain the decision to cancel Unchained.
""After three seasons, we are naturally coming to an end of this cycle. We're very proud of the work we've done and of the public response to the documentary series, which has allowed us to offer a fresh take on this legendary competition,"" the statement read.
""Netflix France will continue to explore new territories in the world of sport.""

The series was designed to introduce cycling to a wider audience, with a focus on countries like the USA, where Formula 1 has seen a big boost in recent years, thanks primarily to the popularity of Netflix's Drive to Survive series.
Unchained was announced back in March 2022 with a host of top WorldTour teams signing on to take part in filming. It cut the 2022 and 2023 Tours, both won by Vingegaard and Visma-Lease a Bike, into eight-episode chunks, and was broadcast in 190 territories around the world.
Before the cancellation was confirmed,Le Parisienreported that the viewing figures for season 2 of the series were ""judged to be average"" across the board, and ""a little disappointing"" in France, with production costs and payments to teams and Tour organiser ASO are also cited as factors in the decision to end the programme.

'I think the form is there' – Mattias Skjelmose bounces back from illness to win before Tour de France,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/i-think-the-form-is-there-mattias-skjelmose-bounces-back-from-illness-to-win-before-tour-de-france/,0.995,"Mattias Skjelmosebounced back from illness at the weekend to round off his preparations to lead Lidl-Trek at theTour de Francewith a second victory of the season at the inaugural edition of theAndorra MoraBanc Clàssica.
The Dane, who will take on the Tour for the second time in his career, saw his preparation for July badly disrupted after he suffered a stomach infection earlier this month.
He was forced to miss both the Critérium du Dauphiné following a bout of the illness that left him ""with a fever and no real ability to eat or recover properly,"" he said in a post to Facebook. An attempted comeback at the Tour de Suisse was also cancelled after the illness returned.
""This isn't the first time things haven't gone to plan – and it won't be the last. But being honest about where I stand doesn't make me any less committed. If anything, it makes the goal even clearer. The Tour de France is still the priority – and I'm fully focused on being ready,""Skjelmose wrote on Facebookwhen announcing he'd miss Suisse.
He returned to action on Sunday in his home base of Andorra, however, getting in one last race day before the Tour at the 115km one-day race, which featured four major climbs and 3,500 metres of elevation.
After three-and-a-half hours of racing, Skjelmose crossed the line first, beating Cristián Rodríguez (Arkéa-B&B Hotels), Enric Mas (Movistar), and Esteban Chaves (EF Education-EasyPost) to the line in a four-man sprint.
He'll now head to the Tour Grand Départ in Lille on July 5 with a vital win in the bag and his illness behind him.

""Of course I'm happy! I was sick for a long time and missed both the Dauphiné and the Tour de Suisse,"" Skjelmose toldCyclismActuafter the race. ""Luckily, I was able to do this race, and I think the form is there for the Tour de France.
""I felt good all day, and the guys did a perfect job. I rode at my own pace, and I knew if I got there, I could sprint.""
2023 Tour de Suisse winner Skjelmose made his Tour debut two years ago, finishing 29th overall, having recorded five top-10 finishes along the way and spending four days in the break. Last summer, he raced to fifth overall at the Vuelta a España, while this season he won his first major Classic, beatingTadej Pogačarand Remco Evenepoel at Amstel Gold Race.
Lidl-Trek have yet to confirm their lineup for the Tour, but Skjelmose will be joined by sprinter Jonathan Milan and all-rounder Thibau Nys as the team aims for success on multiple fronts in France. He acknowledged that the Tour is a different challenge to the Andorran one-dayer but said he can now head to France with renewed confidence.
""It was really great, we had to see how this race would go, but the Tour de France is a completely different race, so we'll see. But after today, I have more confidence, I think we can have a good Tour. I'm looking forward to it.""

"Pogačar, Vingegaard, Evenepoel and Roglič head into final Tour de France preparation at altitude camp",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/pogacar-vingegaard-evenepoel-and-roglic-head-into-final-tour-de-france-preparation-at-altitude-camp/,0.9709,"With theCritérium du Dauphinécompleted and the Tour de France less than three weeks away, Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and the other main favourites for theTour de Francehave headed to their respective final altitude camps, ahead of the July 5 Grand Départ in Lille.
Pogačar and UAE have opted for Isola 2000 for their preparations, as they did last season, and on Monday the world champion was spotted in Sant'Anna di Vinadio by fans, just across the border in Italy.
He was on a 30km ""cappuccino ride"" alongside Jhonatan Narváez, Marc Soler and Pavel Sivakov, as the latter described it on Strava, after they helped guide him to a maiden victory at the Dauphiné.
After his victory, Pogačar said he would be sharpening up on the one weakness from his eight days of racing.
""We go to altitude camp at Isola 2000, then three days home, and to the Tour. There's basically not too much to do. Rest after this great week, do some extra work on the time trial, maybe, and then I'm ready.""
Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike), Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) are all based in Tignes, a little further north in the French Alps, nearer to the finish of the Dauphiné's final stage in Mont-Cenis.
After suffering defeat at the hands of Pogačar, Vingegaard and Visma will hope to improve significantly after their two weeks at altitude, and while the Dane is aware he'll start as second favourite for the Tour, he won't leave any stone unturned in trying to close the gap.

""Tadej is thebiggest favourite[for the Tour]. We only focus on ourselves. We focus on our process to be as good as possible in the Tour. And we still do it, no matter what happens here,"" he said after stage 8.
""I'm going to Tignes, and then I'm going to train to get better and maybe lose a little weight. Time will tell,"" he added, speaking toTV2 Denmark.
Evenepoel's stock has gone done slightly, after he finished well away from Pogačar and Vingegaard at the Dauphiné, but three weeks – most of which is at altitude – is plenty time to work on weaknesses ahead of the Tour.
He posted a casual ride from Tignes yesterday on his Strava of just 46km, with the much more intense training still to come.
Roglič didn't race his rivals in June and opted against defending his Dauphiné title, as he continued to try and recover after crashing several times and eventually out from the Giro d'Italia, having started as the favourite.
He too, is in Tignes, where he has often enjoyed training, as he builds up for another tilt at the Tour, following another DNF at last year's race, his first appearance at cycling's biggest race with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe.
Roglič posted an update to his Instagram after not being such much following the disappointment of the Giro, saying ""Antibiotics done. Back to the mountains. No gagagaga. Que sera sera.""
It sounds like his recovery is done, and he'll be hoping to avoid further crashes at the Tour, something which has often eluded him.
Roglič should be encouraged, however, by the stunning performance of young teammate Florian Lipowitz at the Dauphiné, who beat Evenepoel to third, and could, following that step-up, be on his way to a debut at the Tour de France alongside the Slovenian.

"First team line-up for 2025 Tour de France unveiled as Uno-X Mobility vow 'to shape the stages, not just follow wheels' without Kristoff in final season",N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/first-team-line-up-for-2025-tour-de-france-unveiled-as-uno-x-mobility-vow-to-shape-the-stages-not-just-follow-wheels-without-kristoff-in-final-season/,0.9809,"The first team roster for the 2025Tour de Francehas been unveiled, 19 days before the Grand Départ, with Uno-X Mobility heading into their third appearance in search of a stage win.
VeteranAlexander Kristoffhasn't made the selection in his final season before retirement, withOmloop Nieuwsblad winner Søren Wærenskjoldoperating as their selected sprinter, and 22-year-old Stian Fredheim as a second fast man.
Team general manager Thor Hushovd described it as ""the hardest selection we’ve ever made"", with the eight-man lineup presented at Uno-X Denmark’s headquarters in Søborg.
""Some very strong riders miss out – and that says a lot about how far we’ve come as a team. Every year we raise the bar. We’re still chasing the big one: a Tour stage win, and this team is made for that,"" said Hushovd in ateam release.
""Leaving out Alexander was incredibly tough. He absolutely deserved a final Tour appearance, and I’m confident he would have delivered – just like he always does. But this year, we’ve chosen Søren Wærenskjold as our main sprinter. He’s shown he can win sprints against the very best.""
The opening stage of this year's race should be one for the sprinters, for the first time since 2020 in Nice, when Kristoff took victory riding for UAE Team Emirates.
While the GC isn't an announced goal for the Scandinavian team, twin brothers Anders and Tobias Halland Johannessen will start their first Tour together off the back of a GC win at the Tour of Slovenia and a fifth-place overall finish at theCritérium du Dauphiné, respectively.

The former will be on debut in Lille on July 5, as will Fredheim and Markus Hoelgaard, with Jonas Abrahamsen, Magnus Cort and Andreas Leknessund completing the squad.
""We want to be in the mix every day,"" said Sports Director Gabriel Rasch.
""This team is built to ride aggressively – to shape the stages, not just follow wheels. We have riders for every scenario: breakaways, climbs, sprints. From stage one to the final day in Paris, we’ll be chasing results."""
'The Tour is three weeks with a lot of pitfalls' - veteran team boss Marc Madiot warns Tadej Pogačar of the dangers of the Tour de France,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/the-tour-is-three-weeks-with-a-lot-of-pitfalls-veteran-team-boss-marc-madiot-warns-tadej-pogacar-of-the-dangers-of-the-tour-de-france/,0.9952,"Jonas Vingegaardis still ""missing a little something"" to compete with his Tour de France rivalTadej Pogačarat this year's race but Groupama-FDJ manager Marc Madiot has warned the Slovenian he can never have 100% control of what happens at the Tour.
World champion Pogačar, therefore, tops theTour de France form rankingsahead of the Grand Départ in Lille on July 5, and is the favourite to add a fourth title to his bulging palmarès. Yet Madiot warned that a lot that can change during the race, and plenty of ""pitfalls"" that could hold the 26-year-old back.
""You don't need to be a great expert to say that Pogačar is the number one favourite. But you always have to be wary,"" Madiot toldCyclism'Actu.
""The Tour is three weeks with a lot of pitfalls: the mountains, the time trials, the tricky stages, the wind, managing the peloton...""
""There are a lot of parameters that you try to control, but that you never master 100%. There are always the vagaries of the race. So, everything remains open, even if on paper, Pogačar ticks more boxes than the others.""
Madiot, who raced nine Tours as a pro before working at the race as the French team's manager since the late 90s, said that Vingegaard has catching up to do ahead of this year's race.
All three of last year's podium finishers, as well as other top contender Primož Roglič, are preparing for the race in the Alps at their team's respectivealtitude training camps. Vingegaard, Evenepoel, and Roglič are all based in Tignes, while Pogačar is training further south in Isola 2000.

The trio are all playing catch-up on Pogačar, who has dominated the 2025 season so far with 11 wins in 22 race days, including the UAE Tour, Strade Bianche, the Tour of Flanders, La Flèche Wallonne, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, and the Dauphiné. Vingegaard, Evenepoel, and Roglič have eight wins between them, with their seasons to date affected by various injuries and crashes.
""We can see that Pogačar is at his best, especially in the mountains,"" Madiot said.
""There may still be a few details to adjust on the time trial, but overall, he's been very strong since the start of the season.
""Vingegaard seemed to be in good shape, but he's still missing a little something to compete with Pogačar across the board. There's clearly a gap between the two of them and the rest, even ifRemco Evenepoelis also at an excellent level. Last year's hierarchy seems to be confirmed.""

John Degenkolb joins teammate Fabio Jakobsen on Tour de France sidelines as both recover from separate surgeries,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/john-degenkolb-joins-teammate-fabio-jakobsen-on-tour-de-france-sidelines-as-both-recover-from-separate-surgeries/,0.9192,"Picnic-PostNL teammates John Degenkolb and Fabio Jakobsen had hoped to be part of the team'sTour de Francelineup. However, the team reported Friday that both remained sidelined as they recover from two completely different health issues that required surgery two months ago.
Degenkolb exited the Tour of Flandersjust beyond the halfway point when he crashed in the peloton, along with teammates Tim Naberman and Alex Edmondson. The trio were taken to a nearby hospital, with confirmation of fractures for the German and Dutch riders and Edmondson escaping with a sprained ankle.
Jakobsen was diagnosed with ""flow limitation in the iliac artery in both his legs"", described by his team, andsurgery on April 2 was successful, with his recovery expected to take longer than expected.
“At the start of the year, both John and Fabio were on our long list for the Tour de France, but for both, the race comes too early,"" Rudi Kemna, head coach of Picnic PostNL, said in a team statement.
""Now our priority is to get them both back to full health and have a good training block where they can return to their high level, before we then look to a race program for the second half of the season.”
While Naberman did not require surgery to his wrist, he was off the bike for six weeks. Degenkolb, however, suffered breaks to his collarbone, elbow and wrist and underwent surgery in Frankfurt in early April, several days after the crash. A return to competition for July has been pushed back.
“The injuries John sustained were more serious than we thought from those very first scans and analysis after Flanders. He has had extensive surgery and has been able to ride indoors on the trainer in a controlled environment. However, he still needs follow-up surgery to remove some of the material that is in place to speed up his recovery,"" said Picnic PostNL team doctor Camiel Aldershof in a team statement.

""The timing of this means that he will not be ready to race at the beginning of July. From there, he can ride indoors again, and once things are healed, we can then focus on riding outside and building up his training level and intensities.”
His recovery time was expected to take up to 12 weeks, taking a start at the Tour out of the picture, but then he set his sights on the Vuelta a España at the end of August. Like Degenkolb, the team has now assessed that he will need more time off.
""On the other hand, Fabio had a successful operation and good rehabilitation so far. Firstly, after the needed time off the bike to fully recover from the operation, he was able to start riding indoors at low intensity for 30 minutes per day, and we’ve steadily built that up,"" Dr. Aldershoff added.
""Recently, he’s been able to return to training outside a bi,t which is great, but still at a lower intensity than is required to build up the base again for a three-week Grand Tour.”
After completing the AlUla Tour and UAE Tour, Jacobsen pulled out of Paris-Nice on stage 5, having a tough time early on the hilly course and was one of the first riders to be dropped out of the peloton. He did not finish the Bredene Koksijde Classic or Brugge-De Panne and then had the double artery surgery.
""I was dreading the operation, because it was another major procedure. But the worst is behind us now, and everything is going in a straight line,"" the winter of six Grand Tour stages told NOS.
""The operation was successful, but you lose eight weeks of fitness. You have to build that up again. Then the conclusion is that the Tour comes too early. I dreamed of the Vuelta, which starts on August 23. But I'm advised against it.""
The 28-year-old now looks to return to the peloton in the final weeks of the season, noting Tour of the Netherlands or Tour of Guangxi, both taking place October 14-19."

TheTour de Franceis simply incomparable in the world of cycling.
Le Tour is an integral part of French cultural heritage, with millions lining the roadside to catch a glimpse of the action, and even more watching on across the world as the peloton tackles 21 challenging stages across French terrain over the course of three weeks.
This summer,Tadej Pogačarreturns to the race as favourite, bidding to become only the sixth man to win four yellow jerseys. However, the likes of two-time winnerJonas Vingegaardand last year's third-place finisher Remco Evenepoel will both be keen to spoil the UAE Team Emirates-XRG man's party.
There's also the unknown quantity of Primož Roglič, too, who departed the Giro d'Italia early after several crashes - will he prove a threat when the mountains come into view?
The2025 routecovers 3,320km with 51,550 metres of overall elevation, making it shorter and less vertically taxing than last year's race, but by no means will it make it any easier.
Beginning on Friday, July 5, with a Grand Départ in and around Lille for the first three stages, the 112th edition includes two individual time trials and six mountain stages set to test those vying for the yellow jersey.
This year's race will also feature an inaugural inclusion of Montmartre during the final Champs-Élysées stage on Sunday, July 27, following its success in the Paris Olympics road races last summer. Will this offer a GC contender or stage hunter one last chance at glory, or will the sprinters still prove supreme on the final day?

'He'll be there' - Arnaud De Lie confirmed for Tour de France start despite rollercoaster 2025 season,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hell-be-there-arnaud-de-lie-confirmed-for-tour-de-france-start-despite-rollercoaster-2025-season/,0.99,"Lotto team boss Stéphane Heulot has confirmed that Belgian sprinterArnaud De Liewill ride this year'sTour de Franceas one of three leaders of a 'three-headed snake' leadership strategy.
23-year-old De Lie has raced the Tour once before, in 2024, securing five top five finishes, including tow top three finish on stages 3 and 8. He has 27 wins in his palmares.
De Lie's difficult first half of the 2025 season slowed down his win-rate notably and also raised doubts about whether De Lie would be ready in time for the Tour.
Belgian newspaperDernière Heure'suggested De Lie ""Was like a ghost during the Classics,"" as his race form and race programme was questioned.
However, the Lotto team believe De Lie delivered a much more consistent performance at the Tour de Suisse. Even if there wasn't a win in Switzerland last week, the team could see signs of his improving form despite the exceptionally difficult race route.
Having steadied the ship in the nick of time, Lotto boss Stéphane Heulot gave the official green light to De Lie's Tour participation on Belgian national radio stationRTBF.
""He'll be there,"" Heulot commented. ""The timing's been close but I'm delighted with his evolution in the last week. I've found the Arnaud again that I knew before. Motivated and determined. He's doing fine.""

Heulot pointed out that there had been a false start at the Rund um Köln in mid-May, where De Lie abandoned and a bout of illness and subsequent DNS at Boucles de la Mayenne stage race later the same month.""But there was no emergency stop in his training, otherwise he'd never have finished the Tour de Suisse, given how hard it is. He's ready for the Tour,"" Heulot said.
""I prefer to see the glass half-full and he's fresh and keen to prove things, some as soon as next Sunday in Binche"" - the scene of the Belgian Road National Championships, where De Lie is defending champion.
Lotto's protected rider strategy for the Tour Heulot said, will be completed by two other up-and-coming Belgians alongside De Lie, Lennert van Eetvelt and Jenno Berckmoes.
Van Eetvelt is a former winner of the UAE Tour and Tour de Guangxi and is making his debut in the French Grand Tour after two Vuelta a España participations. Berckmoes is the recent winner of the toughest stage of the Baloise Tour of Belgium.
Like De Lie, both Berckmoes and Van Eeetvelt will race the Belgian Nationals' this weekend prior to heading over the border to Lille and the start of the Tour de France.
De Lie and the rest of the Lotto team will also go to the Tour de France with a new jersey design, with longstanding sponsor CAPS, a fuel and charging card company, added to the maillot.
CAPS' inclusion on the jersey is only provisional though, as Lotto's quest for a long-term second title sponsor continues - so far without any significant breakthroughs."
'We haven't thought that far yet' – Mathieu van der Poel's team focus on winning a Tour de France stage over green jersey ambitions,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/we-havent-thought-that-far-yet-mathieu-van-der-poels-team-focus-on-winning-a-tour-de-france-stage-over-green-jersey-ambitions/,0.9791,"Alpecin-Deceuninck manager Christoph Roodhooft has said that his team hasn't yet made plans to battle for theTour de Francegreen jersey.
Instead, the Belgian revealed that the main goal for his team leaders,Jasper PhilipsenandMathieu van der Poel, will be a stage victory at the Grand Tour.
During the past four editions of the Tour, Philipsen and Van der Poel have combined to take 10 stage wins, a green jersey for the Belgian in 2023, and several days in yellow for the Dutchman in 2021.
Van der Poel has worked as the final lead-out man for Philipsen during many of his nine stage victories as the pair have formed a successful sprint partnership. They'll pair up once again in July, with Van der Poel also seeking his own chances at success.
""We haven't thought that far yet,"" Roodhooft toldSporzawhen asked about the green jersey. ""The priority is the mass sprint on day one.
""For non-climbers, it is a more pleasant Tour to go to. We always go with the ambition to win a stage. We're not going to change that, even if that sometimes sounds like too moderate an ambition. That's certainly not obvious.""
With a mass sprint finish expected on stage 1 in Lille, Philipsen has a shot at the first stage win of the race and with it the yellow jersey. With four further sprint days and Classics-style hilly stages following in the first week, Van der Poel can also have ambitions of riding into yellow.

Roodhooft acknowledged that riders such as Van der Poel and his career-long rivalWout van Aerthave a chance to do just that.
""In a Tour that is so planned, all the types like Mathieu and Wout van Aert have that in their minds,"" he said. ""With the bonuses in the first stages, he can automatically gain some margin towards the time trial. These are opportunities that he must take when they arise.""
Van der Poel impressed at the recentCritérium du Dauphiné, his first race back since fracturing his wrist in a mountain bike crash at the end of May.
He made the break on three of the eight stages, scoring four top-10 placings along the way, and narrowly missing out on the green points jersey.
After the race, he said, ""It was a very hard week, and it wasexactly what I needed for the Tour, so I'm happy."" Roodhooft was also pleased with his efforts.
""We went there with the ambition to win a stage, and Mathieu also narrowly missed out on the green jersey. We can be satisfied in terms of training intensity. That goal was certainly achieved,"" he said.
""Mathieu will still suffer from [his wrist], but in the adrenaline and hectic pace of the race, it wasn't too bad in the end. I think it will be completely forgotten and off the table in three weeks' time - by the start of the Tour."""
Christophe Laporte ruled out of Tour de France participation due to cytomegalovirus,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/christophe-laporte-ruled-out-of-tour-de-france-participation-due-to-cytomegalovirus/,0.8685,"Having already missed out on this year's spring Classics, suffering with cytomegalovirus, Visma-Lease A Bike riderChristophe Laportewill also now miss this summer's Tour de France.
The Frenchman, a stage winner in Cahors at the 2022 race, won't recover from his illness to make a return to the race in July, even if his condition is improving.
Visma-Lease A Bikedirecteur sportif Grischa Niermann provided an update on Laporte's health in an interview withL'Equipe, which confirmed that the 32-year-old racer won't be making the Dutch team's Tour squad.
""Unfortunately, he's been out for a while. He's already missed the entire Classics campaign, and he won't be fit for the Tour,"" Niermann said.
""We hope he'll get back in shape and be able to train as quickly as possible. But, for the moment, he's not 100% yet.""
Laporte hasn't raced yet during the 2025 season as a result of the illness, which reared its head just before he was set to join the team on a training camp in January.
""Right before I was supposed to go on an altitude training camp at the end of January, I started feeling unwell,""Laporte said back in March. ""Tests showed that I have the cytomegalovirus. Since then, I've been recovering, and you have to take things day by day.""

Several of Laporte's Visma teammates, includingJonas Vingegaard, Matteo Jorgenson, Sepp Kuss, and Tiesj Benoot, are currently training at altitude in Sierra Nevada for the Tour, though Laporte isn't part of that group.
Laporte's last racing action came at the tail-end of 2024, when he scored the 32nd win of his career in a two-up sprint to take victory at Paris-Tours.
Niermann conceded that Laporte and the team don't have a set return date in mind.
""He's really, really slowly improving,"" Niermann toldL'Equipe. ""It's getting better and better, but it's taking time, much longer than we'd like and he'd want. But that's life.""
At the end of March, Laporte admitted that a return date would be up in the air, such is the unpredictable nature of recovery from the virus.
""The frustrating part is that you can't predict how long it will take,"" he said.
""With a broken bone, you have an estimate of how long recovery will be before you can train again. With this virus, you can't determine that in advance, which makes it mentally tough."""
'I feel like a completely different person' – Jonas Vingegaard eyes new peak to take on Tadej Pogačar at Tour de France,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/i-feel-like-a-completely-different-person-jonas-vingegaard-eyes-new-peak-to-take-on-tadej-pogacar-at-tour-de-france/,0.9978,"Jonas Vingegaard(Visma-Lease a Bike) is set to race for the first time since March at theCritérium du Dauphinéon Sunday, and says he feels like a ""different person"" from last season heading into theTour de France.
In June 2024, the two-time Tour winner was still a question mark, with his life-threatening crash at Itzulia Basque Country seeing him confirmed as a starter just nine days before the Grand Départ.
But this season, despite anothercrash and concussion at Paris-Niceputting him out of racing for almost three months, the Dane is improving by the day, with the grand aim of taking back the yellow jersey from rivalTadej Pogačar(UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and claiming his third overall win.
""Even last year, going into the Tour, I was still kind of believing that I could go for the win,"" said Vingegaard, speaking toEurosportfrom training camp in Sierra Nevada.
""Obviously, that didn't work out, but this year, I feel like a completely different person, to be honest, in the way my body reacts to training, but also how my body is in general.""
Vingegaard has most recently been spotted near Annecy, as he continues to ramp up his preparations for the start of the Tour in Lille, on July 5, and feels like his shape is steadily improving.
Having lost the Tour last year by more than six minutes and seen world champion Pogačar reach new heights in the Grand Tour arena, Vingegaard is aware he'll need to discover a new peak if he is to defeat cycling's top rider.

""I've always enjoyed the process of getting to the highest possible level for the Tour de France; it's always the big goal, and I always enjoy doing the hard work here,"" said Vingegaard.
""Everybody is taking a step at the moment, so obviously I also need to be better than I was two years ago,"" when he last won the Tour de France, ""but I also have the feeling that I am improving.""
Vingegaard will face off with Pogačar, and third Tour favouriteRemco Evenepoel(Soudal-QuickStep), for eight days of thrilling racing at the Dauphiné next week, and it's a rivalry which the Dane is excited to renew.
The star GC pair have not raced each other since the conclusion of the Tour last season.
""If I were racing without Tadej, it wouldn't be the same, and hopefully, he feels the same the other way around,"" added Vingegaard. ""I actually enjoy having a rival like him.""
The Dauphiné should act as the preview for what is to come across the three weeks of intense racing expected at the Tour in July, where the route will return to the site of two of Vingegaard's biggest triumphs over Pogačar: theCol de la Lozeand Hautacam."
'We're focused on what's going to help us win Grand Tours again' - Ineos Grenadiers' long-term plans go beyond signing Remco Evenepoel,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/were-focused-on-whats-going-to-help-us-win-grand-tours-again-ineos-grenadiers-long-term-plans-go-beyond-signing-remco-evenepoel/,0.9997,"Ineos Grenadiersbelieve they have laid the foundations for a return to Grand Tour success after undergoing a 'cultural rebuild' during the winter.
Possible new sponsorship from TotalEnergies could give the team the funds needed to compete with the super teams andeven sign Remco Evenepoelor the next teenage Grand Tour super talent.
Ineos have abandoned other sports sponsorships in sailing, rugby and football but cycling and winning theTour de Franceagain seems a priority.
TotalEnergies have been reported as a possible new title sponsor alongside Ineos, from as soon as July 1 and this year's Tour de France, while the team could switch from Pinarello bikes to Specialized for 2026 if Evenepoel joins the team, or ride Canyon bikes. A source toldCyclingnewsthat the German direct-to-consumer brand made a 'massive' offer to become the team's bike sponsor.
The arrival of TotalEnergies would allow Ineos to reduce their near 50-million Euro annual sponsorship, while raising the overall budget of the team. A source toldCyclingnewsthat Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe is ready to personally bankroll Evenepoel's transfer and significant salary.
Cyclingnewsspoke to Ineos Performance Director Scott Drawer at theGiro d'Italia. He talked at length about how the team is trying to get ahead of their biggest rivals and how riders' are asked to 'buy-in' to the project and share their opinions.
Cyclingnewsasked Drawer about TotalEnergies and Evenepoel. He refused to comment but indicated that the team has ambitious plans for the future.

""We can't speculate about any investment coming into the team and who is going to be part of our future. Our CEO John Allert has said publicly that we're looking for investment and we'll continue to do that,"" Drawer toldCyclingnews.
Drawer preferred not to answer specific questions about Evenepoel but made it clear that Ineos are constantly studying the rider market.
""We're focused on what the team needs and what's going to help us win Grand Tours again,"" Drawer said.
""We would look at all the candidates. There's a number of other riders that may be available in 2026 or 2027, we keep a good eye on them and talk with the right people at the right time.""
Evenepoel is a logical target for Ineos but so are younger teenage super talents.
""In our view, the probable next Grand Tour winners are going to come through at a very young age, like Tadej Pogačar did and like Isaac del Toro looks set to do,"" Drawer suggested.
""So I think our most critical focus is getting the whole pathway right, I think that's what's going to set the team up for the future. You can look at existing talent that's out there but I definitely think emerging talent will be the future.""

Drawer is careful not to look beyond the current Grand Tour riders on the Ineos roster.
Geraint Thomas is about to retireand probably take a key management role at Ineos alongside Drawer but the team have Egan Bernal, Carlos Rodríguez and also believe in Thyman Arensman. Bernal and Arensman are currently ninth and 13th at the Giro d'Italia but could climb into the top five in the mountainous final week.
""We have some exceptional GC talent in the team, as well as some younger talent that's going to come through very soon. They're only going to go in one direction,"" Drawer said.
""Of course, athlete development is not quite a linear process. Riders can surprise you how quickly they're developing, look at Isaac del Toro. Sometimes you may not need to go to the market because you have the talent already on board.""
Bernal seems back to his best, four years after his terrible training crash that left him with multiple fractures. His contract ends in 2026 but Drawer seems keen to extend the Colombian's time at Ineos. Ultimately, that could depend on Bernal's performance at the Giro d'Italia, and if he is willing to race in support of Evenepoel at the Tour de France.
""I think people can see how well Egan's been doing in the Giro,"" Drawer pointed out.
""There's a lot to come from him in this Grand Tour. He's a great leader, he knows he has the legs, he has the numbers, he has the capability, and he's a competitor, he wants the race, he wants to fight, he wants to compete.""
Drawer returned to Ineos in the spring of 2024 after a spell as head of Sport at the prestigious Millfield School, which has developed many British Olympians. He has also worked for England Rugby and UK Sport and Team GB, leading research and innovation across five Olympic Games cycles.
He spent six months reviewing the performance environment at Ineos and made some significant changes in October after a disappointing season.Tom Pidcock was releasedand allowed to transfer to Q36.5 Pro Cycling and there were significant changes amongst staff.
Drawer is cerebral, not authoritarian. He wants everyone to 'buy-in' to Ineos' plans for the future. That's why Thomas was nominated as the team's 'road captain' and a rider representative group was created to improve dialogue between management, riders and the staff.
""Ultimately, we're about giving riders the opportunity to achieve their best, and if things are not quite working for them, we'll adapt accordingly. I think having that dialogue is quite an important piece of the puzzle,"" Drawer explained toCyclingnews.
""That's the way you move forward as a team. I think that's the best way for modern high performance sports to work. It can't be autocratic.
""I think the modern athlete knows that the dynamic has changed. They want a lot more ownership of it, and we want to give them that. It's the fastest, fastest way you learn and improve.""
Drawer hopes his approach and new sponsorship can help the team catch-up and even leap ahead of their rivals.
""It's about how we're going to get ahead of the curve. There's no point in copying, because everyone will already have moved ahead,"" he explained.
""We spent a lot of time last year and over the winter being a lot more objective about the change in trends and patterns in the sport. We shared that with the riders way back in early December at camp, and we got them actively involved.
""One of the emerging trends, which is not rocket science, is the increase in solo wins and long-range attacks thanks to nutrition and riders like Tadej Pogačar. So in response, you've got to have the physical preparation to be able to execute that, which changes the way you train and prepare for major races.
""Josh Tarling is another example. He's a world-class time trialist, who understands every detail when he does a recon and when he performs at the highest level. Filippo Ganna is the same.
""Philosophically this is about the riders, first and foremost. Putting them in the center of the performances, so you can't exclude them from some of those decisions. We're trying to create an environment where riders feel like they can share technical and tactical information and say where we could be better,"" Drawer continued.
""We want to give them the keys. They've got to make the decisions out on the road, they're the ones feeling the race, they're the ones that know how they feel in the training environment.
""Our long-term plan is for everyone to work collaboratively together so the team has the best chance to succeed."""
The 2025 Tour de France will climb Montmartre just 6km from the finish on final stage,N/A,https://www.cyclingnews.com/news/the-2025-tour-de-france-will-climb-montmartre-just-6km-from-the-finish-on-final-stage/,0.9735,"Details of the final stage of the2025 Tour de Francehave been revealed, with three climbs of the cobbled Montmartre that featured in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games route set to feature.
Tour organisers ASO revealed the 132.3km stage on Wednesday morning. An altered route will pose major challenges to the sprinters who usually thrive on the flat closing laps of the Champs-Elysées. The final climb will come just 6.1km from the finish line, meaning it could well ruin the chances of a stage win for the pure sprinters.
The peloton will enter Paris after 51.7km of racing before taking on four laps of the traditional Champs-Elysées circuit, including one intermediate sprint at the finish line. The race will then shift away to a separate circuit, which will head north to the Côte de la Butte Montmartre, a fourth-category hill measuring in at 1.1km at 5.9%.
The latter part of the stage will bring three laps of the elongated 16.7km Champs-Elysées/Montmartre circuit, with the Montmartre climb set to be pivotal in deciding the victor of the 21st and final day of racing this July.
The climb featured prominently three times in the 272km road race at the Olympic Games last year. Riders sped past the famous Basilica Sacré-Cœur as they crested the climb, and the church will once again feature at this year's Tour.
Belgium'sRemco Evenepoel(Soudal-QuickStep) soloed to victory during the race, which featured a far smaller 90-rider peloton compared to the larger group of riders expected on the Tour's final stage.
Earlier this week, two-time Tour de France championJonas Vingegaardsaid that he was unsure about the climb's inclusion in the final stage of the Tour, noting the difference in peloton size.
The Dane said that the race will bring ""more stress"" than riders would want so close to the end of the Tour.
""I don't know enough about the parcours that day to speak out about that. I know that we will do the Montmartre, but we also don't know how far it is from the finish,"" he said. ""Is it 10km from the finish, or do we still need to do six or seven laps of the Champs-Elysées? Then it's two completely different races, to be honest.
""To be honest, not really,"" he said when asked if it's a good idea to add the climb. ""The Montmartre was nice to do in the Olympics. It seemed good, and there were a lot of people and a really good atmosphere.
""But in that race, when they came to the Montmartre, there were only 50 riders left in the bunch.
""Now, when we do the Tour de France, we will be 150 guys fighting for position on a very narrow climb. So that will be very interesting to do. So, I think it could end up being more stress than we actually want to have. But we will see.""
